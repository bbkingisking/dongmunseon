    한가한 이 몸에 어디가 가장 알맞으리 곽진(郭震)
    가을비에 오동잎 떨어질 때 낙천(樂天)
    서늘한 바람에 부채는 한을 지니고 순흠(舜欽)
    석양은 창 가에서 시 마치라 재촉하네 유수로(兪秀老)
    인간의 화복은 어리석어 모르겠다 낙천(樂天)
    세상의 어려운 일도 취하면 내 몰라라 손하(孫何)
    이윽고 술 깨려니 또 마셔 곤드레 낙천
    청천의 기운 달이 꽃가지를 비추네 정단(程但)

  title: Verses Composed on an Autumn Day
  author: Lim Yu-jeong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Where does this idle body find its truest ease?
    —Guo Zhen

    When autumn rain falls and parasol leaves drift away
    —Bai Juyi

    A cool breeze brings the fan its ancient sorrow
    —Shun Qin

    The setting sun urges the poem's completion at my window
    —Yu Xiulao

    The fortune and misfortune of men—who can fathom such things?
    —Bai Juyi

    The world's difficulties fade when wine brings forgetting
    —Sun He

    Waking from intoxication, I drink again and stumble deeper
    —Bai Juyi

    Beneath the clear heaven, the moon illuminates the blossoming branch
    —Cheng Dan
  footnotes:
    - This poem is composed as a series of quotations from celebrated Tang and Song poets, each line attributed to its source. This technique of weaving together the voices of classical masters was a refined literary practice in Korean literary circles.
    - The parasol tree (wutong) is a traditional symbol of autumn melancholy in Chinese poetry. Its falling leaves represent transience and separation.
    - The fan's 'sorrow' refers to the classical Chinese poetic trope where fans are abandoned when autumn arrives and warmth is no longer needed—a symbol of abandonment and fading love.
    - The poem moves from meditation on idleness through scenes of autumn beauty, ultimately embracing wine and forgetfulness as a response to life's uncertainties and sufferings.
