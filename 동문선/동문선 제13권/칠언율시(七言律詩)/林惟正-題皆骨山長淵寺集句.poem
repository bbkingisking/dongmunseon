    가며가며 승경 찾으니 절로 속된 마음 잊어지네 왕관(王觀)
    좋을손 산에 오르고 물에 임할 때 낙천(樂天)
    어지런 폭포 나는 샘은 쾅쾅 울고 제기(齊己)
    둘러선 봉우리 겹친 산은 울룩불룩 울창하네 자첨(子瞻)
    이내는 아름아름 갠 날에도 젖어 있고 장얼(張臬)
    산빛은 뽀유스름하니 비올 때에 더욱 기이하네 자첨(子瞻)
    이 때 이 경치를 누가 흥겨워하나 지각(智覺)
    홍련사 주인 스님인 벽운 그 분이로세 전기(錢起)

  title: A Poem Composed of Joined Lines at Jangnyeon Temple on Gaegol Mountain
  author: Im Yu-jeong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Walking on and on in search of natural beauty, I forget my worldly cares.
    How fine it is to climb the mountain and stand by the water.
    The chaotic waterfalls and flying streams cry out with splashing sound.
    Layered peaks and stacked ridges rise in wild profusion.
    Mist-light shimmers soft; even on clear days the mountain stays moist.
    The mountain's hue grows hazy; in rain, it becomes even stranger and more wondrous.
    Who among us can truly appreciate this moment and this scene?
    Only the master of Red Lotus Temple, the venerable Bigyun—surely he alone.
  footnotes:
  - key: ''
    value: This poem is composed entirely of 'joined lines' (集句), where each line or couplet is drawn from the works of different Tang and Song Chinese poets, as indicated by the poet names in parentheses in the original. This was a sophisticated literary game among East Asian literati.
  - key: ''
    value: Red Lotus Temple (紅蓮社) and its master Bigyun (碧雲師) likely refer to a specific Buddhist temple and its abbot known to the author, establishing a spiritual connection between the natural beauty described and enlightened appreciation of it.
