    10년 동안 떠돌면서 생애를 저버린 몸
    간 곳마다 차마 어찌 경치를 대하리
    봄바람 가을달에 시는 준비되었고
    나그네 시름 유랑의 회포는 술로 활활
    천추에 전할 만한 공업은 없을망정
    문장은 일가를 이루었구나
    성세에 한가함도 과히 언짢지 않은 일
    내 신세 하불우해도 그대로 맡겨두리

  title: On Advancing and Retreating
  author: Im Chun
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Ten years adrift, I have squandered my life's course.
    Wherever I go, how can I bear to face the beauty of things?
    Spring breeze and autumn moon—poetry awaits me still;
    A wanderer's sorrow, exile's longing—wine dissolves them all.
    Though no great deeds shall pass down through the ages,
    Yet my writings have established their own tradition.
    In this prosperous age, to steal a moment's ease is no disgrace;
    Let my fate turn as it will—I accept what comes.
