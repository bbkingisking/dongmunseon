  text: 秋來征鴈已隨陽。觸物悠悠感恨長。數點鷺鷥沙上白。千頭橘柚道邊黃。山寒却愛形容瘦。稻熟偏知氣味香。爲奉往諧王命重。含杯那復舊時狂。

    가을날 기러기는 벌써 남으로 가는데
    물에 감촉되어 내 한이 그지없네
    모래 위에 흰 몇 점은 해오리가 아닌가
    길가에 누런 것들은 모두 다 귤이로세
    산은 쌀쌀할수록 여윈 모양이 하좋아라
    벼가 다 익어서 향내가 두루 구수하군
    왕명을 받자온 몸 책임이 무거우니
    잔 들고 옛날과 같이 못 노니네

  title: Rhyming Poem on Official Inspection in Seungpyeong County
  author: Choi Young-yeo
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Autumn comes—the geese already follow the southbound sun.
    Touched by the world's affairs, my sorrow flows without end.
    A few white points on the sand—are they not herons?
    All the yellow by the roadside—surely they are tangerines and pomelos.
    The colder the mountain grows, the more I love its lean and gaunt form.
    With ripened grain, fragrance spreads its rich and mellow warmth.
    Burdened with the weight of royal commission and duty,
    I raise my cup, yet cannot revel as in days of old.
