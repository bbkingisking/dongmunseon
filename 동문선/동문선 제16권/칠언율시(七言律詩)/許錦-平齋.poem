  text: 久卧靑氈欲破穿。何人記憶訪蕭然。平生多病知誰使。壯歲無成只自憐。事與世謀違素志。道隨時變慕前賢。泰來莫忘分燈讀。靜處長懷共被眠。

    오래 누웠으니 푸른 담요 다 해지려는데
    뉘 나를 기억하여 쓸쓸한 곳 찾아올꼬
    평생에 다병한 몸 누가 시켜 이러한고
    장년에 이룬 것 없어 스스로 가엾구나
    세속과 일을 맞추자니 본뜻이 틀어지니
    때에 따라 도를 변통하던 선현을 사모하네
    출세하거든 한 등불 하래 글읽었음 잊지 마소
    예전에 한 이불 덮고 자던 일이 생각나네

  title: During Illness at Pyeong-jae
  author: Heo Geum
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Long I have lain upon this worn blue felt,
    Who remembers me enough to seek this lonely place?
    This sickly frame throughout my life—who ordained it so?
    In my prime, nothing gained, I pity only myself.

    When I comply with worldly affairs, my true purpose bends,
    I admire those ancients who adapted their way with the times.
    Should fortune rise, forget not the lamp by which I once read,
    In quiet solitude, I recall those nights we shared one quilt.
  footnotes:
    - Pyeong-jae (平齋) refers to the author's study or retreat, suggesting both a physical space and a state of mind during illness.
    - The 'blue felt' (靑氈) evokes both the humble circumstances of the poet and the worn passage of time through prolonged illness.
    - The contrast between 'worldly affairs' and one's 'true purpose' (素志) reflects the tension between pragmatic survival and philosophical ideals central to Korean literati thought.
    - The final image of sharing 'one quilt' suggests communion with a fellow scholar or spiritual companion, evoking both companionship and the hardships of their shared learning.
