  text: 남편을 섬김에는 순종하면서 의(義)로웠고, 자손을 가르침에는 사랑하면서 엄하였고, 친족에게 대하여는 은혜로우며 주변하였고 노예를 다루는 데는 무섭게 하면서도 용서하였다. 이것은 비록 그의 아름다운 천품에 의한 것이겠으나 역시 인격적으로 서로 대하는 데에서 얻은 바 있으리로다.

  title: In Praise of the Virtuous Mistress of the Kyeongsu Household
  author: Kwon Geun
  language: eng
  text: |-
    In serving her husband, she was obedient yet upheld righteousness.
    In teaching her children and grandchildren, she showed love tempered with severity.
    Toward her kinfolk, she was generous and attentive.
    In managing her servants, she was stern yet merciful.

    Though such virtue may spring from the beauty of her innate nature,
    Surely it was also cultivated through personal integrity
    And the reciprocal harmony of virtuous conduct.
  footnotes:
    - This is a commendatory inscription (贊) praising the virtues of a woman of the household, a traditional genre in Classical Chinese literature.
    - The paired virtues (obedience with righteousness, love with severity, generosity with attentiveness, sternness with mercy) reflect Neo-Confucian ideals of balanced moral conduct.
