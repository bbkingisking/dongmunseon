  text: 몸이 대신이 되어 나라에 업적을 남겼고 집을 학교로 만들었으니 교화에 공이 컸다. 문헌공의 덕은 학자의 모범이 되었다. 후학이 그를 높이여 영원히 그의 덕망을 우러러보도다.

  language: eng
  text: |-
    His body became a pillar of the state,
    leaving lasting deeds for the kingdom.
    His home transformed into a hall of learning,
    contributing greatly to the way of culture.

    The virtue of Lord Munheon
    became the standard for all scholars.
    Later generations revere him,
    forever gazing upon his noble character.
  footnotes:
    - Choe Munheon (崔文憲) was a prominent Goryeo official and scholar. The title 'Munheon' (文憲) is an honorary posthumous name meaning 'Literary and Worthy,' commonly bestowed upon distinguished Confucian scholars and statesmen.
    - The metaphor of the body as 'pillar' (柱石) refers to one who serves as an essential support to the state, a common Confucian ideal for virtuous officials.
