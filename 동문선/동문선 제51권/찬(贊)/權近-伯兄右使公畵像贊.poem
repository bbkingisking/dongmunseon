  text: 얼굴빛이 씩씩함은 그의 정신이 굳세었음을 알 수 있으며 외모가 의젓함은 그의 마음이 바름을 알 수 있다. 친족에게 화목하였음은 그의 인(仁)이며, 친구에게 미더웠음은 그의 후(厚)함이었다. 식견이 밝았고 일을 처리함은 분명하였다. 역량이 컸음은 백성 다스림을 능난히 하였다. 장군도 되었고 대신도 되었으면서 백성의 기대에 신임을 받았으니 이것은 모두 타고나 천품이 훌륭한 까닭이요 학문을 통하여 그렇게 된 것이 아니었다. 나는 비록 그와 동기간이었으나, 훌륭한 형이었고 어리석은 아우이었다.

  title: In Praise of the Portrait of My Elder Brother, Minister of the Right
  author: Gwon Geun
  language: eng
  text: |-
    His complexion glows with vigor—thus we know his spirit runs deep and strong.
    His bearing stands composed—thus we know his heart beats true and right.
    He showed warmth to kinsmen—this was his humanity.
    He proved faithful to friends—this was his generous depth.
    Bright in judgment, precise in all his dealings,
    Vast in talent, skilled in governing the people.
    General and minister both, he commanded the people's trust.

    All these virtues sprang from the excellence of his natural endowment—
    no acquisition through learning could have brought him thus far.
    Though we shared the same womb and drew breath as one,
    he was the worthy elder brother, and I the foolish younger.
  footnotes:
    - This is a commemorative inscription (찬) written to accompany a portrait of the author's elder brother, who served as Minister of the Right.
    - The contrast at the poem's end between the brother's innate virtue and the author's self-deprecating humility reflects both Confucian filial piety and the literary convention of false modesty common in Korean court poetry.
