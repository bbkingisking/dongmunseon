    여러 해로 번복하는 것 매화에도 왔나니
    가난하여 섣달 그믐에 일찍 피지 못했다
    그대 집의 대잎은 분별 없지 않으리니
    지금부터 지팡이 짚고 자주 왕래하려므나

  title: To My Elder Brother Hyuatong of the Yuan Dynasty
  author: Kim Jong-jik
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Through all these years of tumbling fortune, spring has finally reached the plum blossoms.
    In my poverty, through the last days of winter they have not yet bloomed.
    Your home's bamboo leaves are not without meaning for me—
    From this day forward, leaning on my staff, I shall visit you often.
  footnotes:
    - The plum blossom (매화) is traditionally a symbol of virtue and resilience in East Asian poetry, particularly during harsh seasons. Here it may represent the speaker's own fortunes changing.
    - Bamboo leaves (竹葉) carry symbolic weight in classical Chinese and Korean poetry, often representing integrity and flexibility. The reference suggests the speaker seeks wisdom or companionship from their elder brother.
    - The image of leaning on a staff (策杖) suggests both age and the deliberate pace of one returning to visit a dear relation.
