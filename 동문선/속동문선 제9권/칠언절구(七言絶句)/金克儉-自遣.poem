    늙어서 깨달으매 이 몸은 어찌 그리 어리석은가
    곧 자취를 거두려 생각하고 강호에 누워 있다
    이내 승냥이와 이리 같은 뜻을 잡아 물리쳐 버리고
    굳센 벌레에 붙여 주어 토끼와 여우를 친다

    In my old age I awaken to this truth—
    how foolish I have been all along.
    So now I gather up my tracks and turn away,
    to lie at rest beside the river.

    I cast aside the wolf and jackal's hunger,
    the predatory dreams that gnawed within.
    I offer them instead to the fierce beetle,
    to let it chase the rabbit and the fox.
  footnotes:
    - '"River" (江湖) traditionally symbolizes a reclusive life withdrawn from worldly affairs in classical Chinese poetry.'
    - The imagery of insects, rabbits, and foxes represents the poet redirecting petty ambitions and worldly desires toward insignificant pursuits, thereby freeing himself from them.
