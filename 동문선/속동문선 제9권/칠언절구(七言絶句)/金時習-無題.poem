    돌샘물은 얼어 붙고 대사립문 걸었나니
    마음의 한가함을 넉넉히 얻었으매 일일이 한가하다
    처마 그림자가 창에 들자 비로소 선정에서 나와
    때때로 멎은 눈뭉치가 소나무 사이에 떨어지는 소리 듣는다

    The stone spring freezes over, the bamboo gate closes shut.
    With a peaceful heart obtained in full measure, all things settle into ease.
    As the eaves' shadow enters the window, I emerge at last from meditation.
    Now and then I hear the sound of melting snow falling softly through the pines.

    - Kim Si習(1435-1493) was a prominent Korean scholar, poet, and monk during the Joseon dynasty, known for his literary refinement and spiritual pursuits.
    - The progression from external stillness (frozen spring, closed gate) to internal peace (heart at ease) to emerging awareness (shadow entering, sounds heard) reflects a Buddhist meditative experience.
