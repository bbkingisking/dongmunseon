    티끌 사이 영욕 속에 몇 번이나 봄이었나
    안독의 무더기 곁에 흰 털이 새로워라
    밤중에는 숲 속에 숨을 계획 익혔는데
    밝은 아침 또다시 돌아가지 못하는 사람 되었네

  title: Following the Rhyme of Gyeongju Provincial Hall
  author: Choi Eung-hyeon
  language: eng
  text: |-
    How many springs have passed amid the dust and tumult of this world?
    Beside the heap of documents, new white hairs have emerged.
    At midnight, I've grown skilled at plotting escape in the forest depths,
    Yet by morning's light, I remain—still unable to turn back.
  footnotes:
  - key: ''
    value: The 'Provincial Hall' (영청) refers to the administrative seat where the author likely served as an official, suggesting this is a reflective poem written during his tenure.
  - key: ''
    value: The contrast between nocturnal dreams of escape and morning's inescapable duties reflects the tension between personal desire and official obligation—a common theme in classical East Asian literati poetry.
