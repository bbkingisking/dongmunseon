    꽃을 불고 버들을 포개는 반 강의 바람인데
    돛대 그림자는 흔들흔들 저녁 기러기를 등진다
    한 조각 고향 마음이 하염엾이 기둥을 의지하면
    흰 구름은 날아 술 실은 배를 지나간다

  title: In Response to Hong Gyeom-seon's Poem on the Jecheon Pavilion, Following the Rhyme of Song Jung-chu, Cheo Kwan
  author: Kim Jong-jik
  language: eng
  text: |-
    The wind of half the river blows through flowers and bends the willow branches.
    The mast's shadow sways and sways, turning its back on the evening geese.
    A fragment of homesickness leans helplessly against the column,
    While white clouds drift past the wine-laden boat.
  footnotes:
    - The Jecheon Pavilion was a gathering place for scholars and officials. This poem responds to an earlier composition by Hong Gyeom-seon, maintaining his original rhyme scheme as was customary in the scholarly poetry exchanges of the Joseon period.
    - The imagery of the boat, geese, and distant clouds evokes the bittersweet longing of separation, a common theme in classical East Asian poetry.
