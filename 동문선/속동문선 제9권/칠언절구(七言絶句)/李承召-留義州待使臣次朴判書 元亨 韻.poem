    여관에서 물화의 변하는 것에 몹시 놀라나니
    바람이 유막을 불어 푸른 빛이 아름답게 비낀다
    산성은 땅이 궁벽해 남은 추위가 있어
    오월에야 처음으로 작약꽃을 본다

  title: Written While Awaiting a Messenger to Uiju, Rhyming with Park the Minister of Judgement, Won-heng
  author: Lee Seung-so
  language: eng
  text: |-
    In this traveler's lodge I marvel at how quickly the world transforms.
    The wind sweeps through the willow screens, their emerald grace bent and askew.
    The mountain fortress lies remote—even in May, winter's chill remains.
    Only now, in the fifth month, do the peonies bloom at last.
  footnotes:
    - Uiju (義州) is a historical region in present-day North Korea, an important diplomatic meeting point during the Joseon period
    - Park the Minister of Judgement (朴判書 元亨) was likely the recipient or occasion for this poem
    - Peonies (芍藥) blooming in May suggests a northern location where spring arrives late
