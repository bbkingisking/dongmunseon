    남창 앞에 종일 앉아 세속 일 잊었노라
    정원에는 사람 없고 새는 날기 배우네
    부드러운 풀의 그윽한 향기를 찾기 어려운 곳인데
    맑은 연기와 저녁 햇볕에 비가 보슬거린다

  title: A Song Composed in Recovery from Illness
  author: Kang Hee-maeng
  language: eng
  text: |-
    By the south window I sit the whole day through, the world's concerns forgotten.
    In the empty garden, a bird learns to fly.
    The delicate fragrance of tender grass dwells in places hard to find—
    Through pale mist and the fading light of dusk, a gentle rain falls soft.
  footnotes:
    - The 'south window' evokes the tranquility sought by reclusive scholars in East Asian tradition, suggesting the poet's retreat from worldly affairs during convalescence.
    - The bird learning to fly may symbolize the poet's gradual recovery and return to vitality, mirroring nature's own renewal.
