    세상 밖의 신성한 벗에 혜휴가 있으니
    소나무 바람과 파초의 빗소리에 일찍이 놀던 일 생각한다
    해마다 유월이 되면 불꽃 먼지가 넘치는데
    용천의 한 움큼 가을을 내게 주었네

  title: In Thanks to Monk Dharma Master for the Gift of a Fan from De-Bang
  author: Kim Jong-jik
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Beyond the worldly realm, there dwells a sacred friend in Hye-hyu—
    I recall our wanderings through pine winds and banana-leaf rains.
    Each year when the sixth month arrives, dust and heat swell like flames,
    Yet you have given me a handful of autumn from the dragon springs.
  footnotes:
    - The 'dragon springs' (용천) likely refers to a temple or sacred location associated with cool, refreshing water—a metaphorical contrast to the summer heat mentioned in the previous line.
    - The gift of a fan carries symbolic meaning in East Asian poetry, representing both practical comfort and spiritual companionship.
