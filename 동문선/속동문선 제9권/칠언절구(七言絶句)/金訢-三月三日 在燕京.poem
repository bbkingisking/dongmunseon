    비로소 백오와 삼삼을 지내거니
    객지에서 세월 가는 것을 어찌 견디리
    우선 좋은 때를 따라 맛좋은 술을 살꺼나
    살구꽃 핀 서쪽언덜에 청렴이 나부낀다

  title: Third Day of the Third Month in Yanjing
  author: Kim Hyun
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Spring has passed through its hundred and five days, now three more three—
    How can I bear the years slipping away in foreign lands?
    Let me seize this perfect moment and buy fine wine,
    While green curtains flutter in the western corner where apricot blossoms bloom.
  footnotes:
    - The 'hundred and five' (백오) refers to the 105th day after winter solstice, marking the Cold Food Festival, a traditional time of remembrance. The poet juxtaposes this passage of time with the present third day of the third month, emphasizing the swift turning of seasons.
    - The image of the green curtain (청렴) fluttering among apricot blossoms suggests a tavern or wine house, a refuge for the homesick traveler seeking solace and connection in a distant capital.
