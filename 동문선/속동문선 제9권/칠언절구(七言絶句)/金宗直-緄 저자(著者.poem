    사향을 조리하고 주사를 굽는 늙은 할미가 있어
    문에 나가 맞이했으나 손바닥의 명주를 보지 못했네
    하늘의 후박은 진실로 알기 어렵도다
    봄이 따사로와 닭보금자리엔 8ㆍ9마리 병아리 있거니

  title: On the Eighth Month
  author: Kim Jong-jik
  language: eng
  text: |-
    An old woman grinds musk and refines cinnabar,
    Yet stepping out to greet the visitor, she holds no pearl in her palm.
    Heaven's favor and disdain—truly hard to fathom—
    Spring warmth brings eight or nine chicks nestled in the coop.
  footnotes:
    - The musk and cinnabar refer to precious substances, suggesting wealth or abundance; the pearl represents a treasured gift or blessing.
    - The contrast between the old woman's labor with valuable materials and her inability to offer a precious gift to her visitor reflects on the paradox of human fortune and divine providence.
    - The poem shifts to spring imagery, where humble creatures like chicks multiply in warmth, suggesting that nature's provisions may exceed human expectations in unexpected ways.
