    매화는 눈과 같고 눈은 매화같은데
    흰 눈이 올 앞날에 매화가 바로 피리니
    알괘라 이 하늘과 땅의 한 맑은 기운인데
    모름지기 눈을 밟으며 매화 보러 오리라

  title: In Response to Yun Hong-ju's Poem on Plum Blossoms, and in Honor of the Gentleman of Eastern Wu
  author: Seo Geo-jeong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Plum blossoms are like snow, and snow is like plum blossoms.
    Before the white snow arrives, the plums open in full bloom.
    I know it is a single clear essence of heaven and earth—
    So I shall trudge through the snow to see the plums come.
  footnotes:
    - The title references a poetic exchange form popular in classical East Asian poetry, where poets would compose verses responding to and building upon earlier works. 'Eastern Wu' (東吳) is an allusion to refined literati traditions. Seo Geo-jeong's poem plays with the metaphorical ambiguity between plum blossoms and snow, suggesting both their visual resemblance and their shared spiritual significance as symbols of purity and resilience in the cold season.
