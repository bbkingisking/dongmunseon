    꽃다운 물가를 천천히 걷다가 짧은 지팡이를 의지하나니
    잔잔한 푸른 물결에 파란 봉우리가 잠기었다
    산 곁의 큰 나무들은 마을 언덕을 감추었는데
    섬섬한 찬 까마귀는 저녁 절구 소리를 띠었다

  title: 'Evening Walk at Sandy Pavilion: A Poem Composed for Ju Gunju''s Request'
  author: Kim Heun
  language: eng
  text: |-
    I wander slowly by the flowering shore,
    Leaning upon my slender staff.
    The tranquil blue waters embrace
    The jade peaks reflected in the evening light.

    Tall trees beside the mountain
    Hide the village and its slopes,
    While the sharp-eyed crows,
    Faint and distant, carry the sound of the mortar
    Into the gathering dusk.
  footnotes:
    - The 'mortar' (절구, jeolgu) likely refers to the traditional stone mortar used for grinding grain, whose rhythmic sounds mark the transition into evening—a common image in East Asian poetry signifying the passage of day and the return home.
    - The 'slender staff' (짧은 지팡이) suggests both physical support for the aged wanderer and the poet's contemplative stance as an observer of nature.
