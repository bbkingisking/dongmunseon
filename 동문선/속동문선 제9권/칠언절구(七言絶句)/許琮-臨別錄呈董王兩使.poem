    푸른 연기는 막막하고 풀은 이리하거니
    바로 이것이 강 머리에 송별하는 때이네
    잠자코 서로 바라보며 생각이 한이 없는데
    이 생에 어느 곳에서 다시 서로 따르리

  title: Farewell Record Presented to the Two Envoys, Dong and Wang
  author: Heo Jong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Blue mist hangs thick and the grasses wave in disarray—
    This is the hour of parting by the river's edge.
    In silence we gaze at each other, hearts brimming with unspoken longing,
    Yet in this life, where shall we meet to follow one another again?
