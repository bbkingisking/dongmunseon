    세상과 이름 모두 다 버리고서
    한가히 두는 바둑 한 판에 돌을 자주 두드린다
    그 가운데 묘한 솜씨 아무도 모르는데
    마땅히 안유의 높은 한 수 있으리라

  title: The Four Immortals at the Go Board
  author: Seo Geo-jeong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Having fled from the world and worldly fame,
    I play a quiet game of go, tapping stones again and again.
    The subtle skill within escapes all eyes—
    Yet surely there lies wisdom worthy of the ancients.

    value: The 'Four Immortals' (四皓) were legendary recluses who refused to serve in government, symbolizing retreat from the world. The game of go serves as a metaphor for the poet's withdrawal from public life and pursuit of inner cultivation.
  - key: ''
    value: The reference to 'An and Liu' alludes to sage advisors known for their transcendent understanding, suggesting that true mastery reveals itself in the most unassuming forms.
