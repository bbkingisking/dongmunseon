    한 치의 뿌리를 앞 섬돌 가까이 옮겨 심었더니
    어느 새 우뚝우뚝 푸른 일산 기울인 듯
    서리 맞은 껍질이 마흔 아름쯤 되기를 기다려
    푸른 이끼 찍어내고 흐르는 송진 받으리라

  title: Pine
  author: Lee Seung-so

  text: |-
    A single inch of root transplanted near the front stone step—
    Already the verdant canopy rises proud and tall.
    Waiting for frost-weathered bark to span four fathoms round,
    I'll scrape away the blue-green moss and catch the flowing resin.
  footnotes:
    - The 'front stone step' (섬돌) suggests a garden or courtyard setting, marking the pine as a cultivated specimen rather than a wild tree. The poem traces the tree's growth from sapling to mature timber.
    - The 'four fathoms' (마흔 아름, literally forty ells) represents the desired girth of a mature pine, a measure of both time and the tree's noble development.
    - Pine resin (송진) holds practical and symbolic significance in Korean culture—both a useful material and a marker of the tree's vitality and value.
