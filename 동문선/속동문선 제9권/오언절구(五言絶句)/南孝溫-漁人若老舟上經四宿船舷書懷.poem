    불을 피워서 고기 내장을 굽고
    띠풀을 엮어 조그만 그늘을 만들다
    배 안에서 아침과 저녁을 지내는데
    연기와 비에 한 강이 깊었다

  title: 'Written on a Boat: Four Nights Passing the Riverside'
  author: Nam Hyo-on
  language: eng
  text: |-
    I kindle fire to roast the fish's heart,
    Weave reeds to fashion a small shelter's shade.
    Within the boat, morning becomes evening,
    As smoke and rain deepen the river's face.
  footnotes:
    - The 'fish's heart' suggests both literal sustenance and the essence of the fisherman's humble life.
    - The shelter made from woven reeds evokes the temporary, impermanent nature of the poet's journey.
    - The blending of time ('morning becomes evening') reflects the dissolution of temporal boundaries in solitude.
    - The final image merges the material world (smoke from the fire, falling rain) with the river itself, suggesting how the poet's small human presence becomes absorbed into the larger landscape.
