    게으른 손이 턱을 고이고 누워
    시를 더듬다 한낮이 되었다
    비취의 한 소리 들려 오나니
    그것은 역 창의 동쪽에서 울고 있다

  title: Afternoon Meal at Sagun Station
  author: Lee Kyong-dong

  text: |-
    A weary traveler leans cheek upon his hand,
    Reclined as I grope for verses through the noon.
    Then comes a jade bird's cry—
    Singing from the eastern window of the station.
  footnotes:
    - The 'jade bird' (翡翠) refers to a kingfisher, whose brilliant plumage was compared to jade in classical Chinese poetry. Its sudden cry breaks through the speaker's drowsy meditation.
    - The station (驛) serves as a liminal space where the traveler finds himself between journeys, and his creative thought suspended between weariness and inspiration.
