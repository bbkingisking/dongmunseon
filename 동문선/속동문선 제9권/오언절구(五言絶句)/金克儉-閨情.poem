    삼동의 옷을 전하지 못해
    부질없이 밤중의 다듬이를 재촉한다
    은항이 마치 나와 같아서
    눈물이 다하자 문득 마음 태운다

    Winter clothes still undelivered—
    I hasten the fulling block's beat through midnight in vain.
    The silver lamp burns like myself,
    and when my tears run dry, it sears my heart.

    value: The three winters refer to the winter season or a prolonged winter absence, suggesting the speaker's husband or beloved has been away. The fulling block (砧) is used to soften and finish cloth—here a symbol of the speaker's anxious labor. The silver lamp (銀缸) personifies the speaker's own suffering, burning away as her tears exhaust themselves.
