    졸졸 흐르는 한 움큼 물이
    맑고 깨끗해 빙옥을 담은 듯
    비록 관개의 공에는 부끄러움 있지만
    손으로 움켜 떠서 먹을 만하다

  title: Cold Spring
  author: Kim Cheon-ryeong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    A trickle of water, a mere handful,
    Clear and pure as jade kissed by frost—
    Though it shames me it cannot irrigate the fields,
    Still, it is enough to cup in trembling hands and drink.
  footnotes:
    - The poem contrasts the spring's modest flow with its crystalline beauty, suggesting that not all things of worth need serve grand purposes.
    - The imagery of ice and jade evokes the aesthetic refinement valued in classical East Asian poetry, where spiritual purity often transcends practical utility.
