    동쪽에서 해가 떠 환히 밝은데
    신령한 비에 나뭇잎 떨어진다
    창을 열매 모든 생각 맑아지나니
    병든 몸에서 날개가 생기려 한다

  title: Written on the Window Wall of Wongtong Hermitage on Seongeo Mountain
  author: Nam Hyoong-on
  language: eng
  text: |-
    In the east the sun rises, bright and radiant,
    As sacred rain strips the leaves from every tree.
    Opening the window, ten thousand cares dissolve,
    And from this ailing frame, wings seem to sprout.
  footnotes:
    - Seongeo Mountain (聖居山) is a sacred site in Korean Buddhist tradition, home to several important temples and hermitages.
    - The hermitage setting and imagery of spiritual awakening suggest this poem was likely written during a period of retreat or illness, common themes in East Asian literati culture.
    - The progression from natural observation to spiritual transformation reflects the classical Buddhist and Daoist theme of enlightenment through nature's manifestation.
