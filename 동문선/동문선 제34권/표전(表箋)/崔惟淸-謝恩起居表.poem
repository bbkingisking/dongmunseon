  text: 일찍이 용안(龍顔)을 뵈었사오니 심상한 그리움보다 갑절이나 간절하오며, 봉조(鳳詔)를 받자올 때마다 지척(咫尺)에서 위엄을 친히 모시듯이 멀리 만세를 축수하는 이 정성을 높은 해가 비추어 주실 줄 믿사옵니다.

  title: Memorial of Gratitude for Imperial Favor
  author: Choi Yu-cheong
  language: eng
  text: Having once beheld the Dragon Countenance of Your Majesty, my longing grows manifold deeper than ordinary affection. Each time I receive the Phoenix Edict, it is as though I stand in the very presence of celestial authority. I humbly trust that the Radiant Sun itself shall illuminate this distant servant's earnest prayers for ten thousand years of imperial grace.
  footnotes:
    - Dragon Countenance and Phoenix Edict are classical metaphors for the emperor's presence and imperial edicts respectively.
    - The phrase 'ten thousand years' expresses wishes for the emperor's eternal reign and prosperity.
    - This memorial employs the formal register of court petitions, combining expressions of personal devotion with cosmic imagery to honor imperial benevolence.
