  title: A Feline Admonition
  author: Lee Je-hyeon
  language: eng
  text: |-
    You have ears to hear and eyes to see,
    Claws sharp and fangs to match—
    yet the mice dance and dart about,
    and all you do is sleep.
    Why do you not wake?
  footnotes:
    - This is a moral admonition cast in the form of reproach toward a cat for its laziness and dereliction of duty, reflecting the Confucian concern with proper conduct and fulfilling one's role in the social order.
