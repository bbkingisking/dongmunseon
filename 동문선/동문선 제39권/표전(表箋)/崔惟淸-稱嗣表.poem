  text: 신 휘는 아롭니다.엎드려 생각하건대, 높은 것으로써 낮은 것을 들어주심이 덕(德)이요, 아래로써 위를 받듦이 충성이기에, 이제 절박한 회포를 진달(陳達)하여 우러러 총명한 살피심을 바랍니다. 신 휘(諱)는 진실로 애통하고 진실로 애절하여, 머리를 조아리고 머리를 조아립니다.엎으려 생각하건대, 신의 아버지 선신(先臣) 휘가 맨 먼저 황제께 조공하고, 양조(兩朝)를 내리 섬기어 충순(忠順)으로 정성을 다하여, 항상 조공을 솔선 이행하다가, 근로(勤勞)로 수(壽)를 감하여 갑자기 신민(臣民)을 버리었습니다. 신이 세자(世子)의 작은 몸으로 외람되이 유명(遺命)을 받았기에, 종직(宗職)이 중하므로 임시로 유업(遺業)을 지키매, 근심과 슬픔이 겹치는 중에 송구함이 지극하여, 요좌(僚佐)와 군인들로 더불어 각기 안정시키고 나서, 삼가 모관(某官) 이지무(李之茂)를 사신으로 보내어 표를 받들어 아롭니다.

  title: Memorial on the Succession of Rank

  text: |-
    Your servant humbly speaks. It is understood that the elevated should hear the lowly as virtue, and the inferior should serve the superior as loyalty. Therefore, your servant now presents this urgent petition, gazing upward to receive your enlightened judgment. Your servant grieves with true sorrow, with heartfelt anguish, and bows his head repeatedly in reverence.

    Your servant reflects upon his late father, who first paid tribute to the throne, serving faithfully through two reigns, dedicating himself wholly to loyalty and devotion. He was diligent in fulfilling court obligations, yet his labor wore upon his years until he suddenly passed from among your servants and people. Your servant, though of humble station, has undeservedly received his father's final testament. As the burden of family duty weighs heavily, your servant temporarily guards the inheritance left behind. Amidst accumulated sorrow and anxiety, your servant trembles with apprehension. Having worked with his counselors and officers to maintain stability and order, your servant now respectfully dispatches his emissary, the official Yi Jimuk, to present this memorial for your consideration.
