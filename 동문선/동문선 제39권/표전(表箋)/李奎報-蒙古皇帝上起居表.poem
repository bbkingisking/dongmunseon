  text: 천리 청구(靑丘)에 비록 구구한 분수를 지키나 구중(九重) 단궐(丹闕)에 목목(穆穆 깊고 먼 것)한 안식을 상상하며, 천수(天壽)의 가이없음을 축원함이 다만 신심(臣心)의 가진 바입니다.

  title: A Respectful Address to the Mongol Emperor
  author: Lee Gyeong-bo
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Though I keep to my distant station in this green land of a thousand leagues away,
    I gaze in longing toward the nine-tiered vermilion halls of solemn majesty.
    I offer prayers for the Emperor's days to be boundless as heaven itself—
    This alone is the sincere devotion that dwells within this subject's heart.
  footnotes:
    - The 'green land' (靑丘) refers to Korea, while the 'nine-tiered vermilion halls' (九重丹闕) represent the imperial court of Mongolia—emphasizing the vast distance and hierarchy between the vassal state and its overlord.
    - This work was composed during the Goryeo dynasty's period under Mongol domination, reflecting the political reality of the time through formal court language.
