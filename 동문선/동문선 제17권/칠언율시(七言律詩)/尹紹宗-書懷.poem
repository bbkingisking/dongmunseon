  text: 孤身野服謁天門。玉色溫溫授正言。更把何心謀性命。重懷古義誓乾坤。未封社稷安危計。大負君王眷拔恩。千載不欺皇上帝。陳湯劉向二忠魂。 公爲正言。草疏請黜倖臣金興慶。斬寵宦廣大。同舍覺之。希興慶旨。亟以他事劾公。使不得上疏。按漢書。王鳳以陳湯爲從事中郞。幕府事一决於湯。劉向雅奇湯智勇。與之友善。謂湯曰。今外家日盛。必危劉氏。吾幸以同姓。蒙漢厚恩。吾而不言。孰當言者。遂上封事。極諫公意。盖以湯旣爲鳳所信任。若不爲漢計。洩向言於鳳。則鳳必先去向矣。向之封事。安得上乎。深嘆今同舍之不然也。

    외로운 몸이 야복으로 임금님을 뵈었더니
    옥음도 다사로이 정언 벼슬을 주셨더니라
    다시 무슨 마음 내 목숨 생각하리
    거듭 옛 의를 품고 천지에 맹세했네
    국가 안위의 큰 상소를 못 올렸으니
    임금님 발탁하신 은을 크게 저버렸구나
    천 년 전에 하느님을 속이지 않은 분
    진탕과 유향 두 분의 충성된 혼

  title: Reflections on My Heart
  author: Yun Sojong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    A lonely man in rough garb kneels before the throne,
    And the royal voice, gentle as jade, bestows the rank of Remonstrator upon me.
    Yet what heart can I harbor for my own life?
    I have sworn myself anew to ancient virtue before heaven and earth.
    Unable to present the great memorial on the realm's fate,
    I have betrayed the Emperor's grace in raising me up.
    Those from a thousand years past who never deceived the Lord Above—
    Chen Tang and Liu Xiang, two souls of loyalty.
  footnotes:
    - Chen Tang and Liu Xiang were historical figures known for their moral courage in remonstrating with their rulers. Chen Tang served as a trusted advisor and Liu Xiang was known for his wisdom and righteousness in speaking truth to power, even at personal risk.
    - The poem references the author's failure to submit a memorial criticizing court favoritism due to interference by colleagues seeking to protect the emperor's favorites, suggesting the author's regret at compromising his duty.
    - The rank of Remonstrator (正言) was a position specifically designated for officials to advise the ruler and speak against wrongdoing at court.
