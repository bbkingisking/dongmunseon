    불법이 이 나라에 오래 크게 행해졌거늘
    선생이 분기하여 주ㆍ정을 이었네
    개연히 성현을 끌어 사특한 설을 배척하고
    높직히 천리를 알아 천형을 논했도다
    천형은 담암이 지은 성리론 나라의 사명(외교문서)을 뉘 이제 윤색하리
    어둠을 깨쳐 주는 고명을 다시 우러를 데 없네
    기나긴 만세 황천 밑 저승에서
    옛 친구 좇아 놀 이는 우리 율정(윤택의 호)뿐이리
    율정(栗亭)과는 동방급제(同榜及第)였다.

  title: Elegy for Baek Chung-gan, Duke of Damam
  author: Yun Sojong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    In this eastern land, the Buddha's teachings have long flourished and spread,
    Yet the Master arose and carried forward Zhou and Cheng's noble way.
    With solemn voice he summoned the Sage to sweep away heretical claims,
    And standing firm in understanding Heaven's principle, he expounded embodied form.

    Embodied form—the teaching of Principle and Nature that Damam composed—
    Who now shall polish and perfect the nation's sacred word?
    The fog once lifted by his brilliant light finds none to raise its lamp,
    And through ten thousand ages, beneath the yellow springs,
    Only one old friend remains to follow where he walks—
    My companion Yul-jeong in that distant shore.

    We had passed the examination together in the same year.
  footnotes:
    - Zhou and Cheng refer to the Neo-Confucian philosophers Zhou Dunyi, Cheng Hao, and Cheng Yi of the Song Dynasty, founders of the School of Principle (Xingxue) that shaped East Asian philosophy.
    - Embodied form (践形) refers to the actualization of Heaven's principle in human nature, a central concept in Neo-Confucian philosophy that Baek Chung-gan explored in his writings.
    - Yul-jeong (栗亭) was Yun Sojong's courtesy name, and this elegy expresses the poet's grief that he alone remains to remember his departed friend.
