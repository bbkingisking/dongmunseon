    분분한 구름비 흐릴락 맑을락
    태산은 홍모같이 가벼워라
    하늘 가 외로운 베개는 고향 가는 꿈 뿐인데
    달 아래 뉘 집에서 저 부는 소리
    한평생에 골육은 세 번 먼 이별하였구나
    만길 파란에 한 부생이로세
    돗자리 만한 땅이 남쪽으로 끝났다 탓하지 마소
    눈 앞에 다시 질펀한 바다 있지 않나베

  title: Miscellaneous Verses on Wol-ju
  author: Lee Chaem
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Clouds and rain scatter, now darkening, now clearing—
    even Mount Tai grows light as a swan's feather.
    On a lonely pillow at the world's edge, I dream only of home,
    and beneath the moon, whose house plays that distant flute?

    Bone and blood part three times in a hundred years of life.
    Ten thousand fathoms of waves—a single floating span of days.
    Do not lament that the land, small as a mat, ends to the south:
    there remains before your eyes the boundless sea spread wide and level.
  footnotes:
  - key: ''
    value: Mount Tai (태산) is a metaphor for greatness rendered insignificant by perspective, reversing the famous Daoist image of the feather.
  - key: ''
    value: The 'three distant partings' likely refers to the separations inherent in a life lived far from family—perhaps exile, travel, or the natural distance that grows between loved ones.
  - key: ''
    value: The final couplet suggests that even life's constraints and endings reveal greater horizons—a consolation in the face of limitation.
