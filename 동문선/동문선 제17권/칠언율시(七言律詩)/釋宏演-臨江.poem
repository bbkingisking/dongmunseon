    바라보니 강 마을에 단풍잎 날리는데
    서리는 땅에 가득 옷이 축축하구나
    늙으신 내 어머님 방금 생각던 차
    그대 고향에 돌아간단 말 듣기도 두렵소
    바다의 어룡들은 가을 물이 써늘한데
    동남의 옛 친구들은 새벽 별처럼 드물구나
    푸른 산 맑은 강이 즐길 만하거니
    어쩌다 고산 고사릴 내사 캐지 않으리

    I gaze upon the riverside village where maple leaves scatter,
    Frost adorns the earth and soaks through my garments.
    Just now my aging mother crossed my mind—
    I dread to hear you speak of returning to your homeland.

    In these waters, dragons and fish drift in autumn's cold chill,
    And old friends of the southeast grow sparse as fading dawn stars.
    The emerald peaks and crystalline river invite joy and wandering,
    Yet how can I gather ferns from that ancient mountain?

  - key: ''
    value: The gathering of ferns (薇) is a reference to virtue and hermitage, evoking the ancient sage who refused to serve a fallen dynasty.
