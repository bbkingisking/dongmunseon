    천 리에 떠다니는 나그네
    쓸쓸한 몇 집 마을
    끊어진 꿈을 어이 다시 이으리
    싸늘한 마음 상기 못 따스하네
    묵느라니 철 바뀜이 놀랍고야
    울적한 심사를 거문고 술로 풀어가네
    그저 몸 건강하면 그만이니
    다른 것이야 논하여서 무엇하리

  title: A Letter to Heonchun Pavilion
  author: Jung Po
  language: eng
  text: |-
    A wanderer adrift across a thousand leagues,
    In a desolate village of but a handful of homes.
    My broken dreams—how shall I mend them?
    My chilled heart still cannot find its warmth.

    Stuck here, I marvel at the turning seasons,
    And ease my melancholy with zither and wine.
    If only this body remains in health,
    What need is there to speak of anything else?
  footnotes:
    - The 'thousand leagues' evokes both physical distance and emotional separation from home
    - The zither (거문고) represents artistic expression as solace, a common motif in Korean classical poetry
    - The final couplet expresses a philosophical resignation—that contentment with bodily wellness transcends other worldly concerns
