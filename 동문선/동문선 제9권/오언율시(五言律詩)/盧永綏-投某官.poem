    벼슬 길[宦海]에 풍파가 사나와서
    궁한 고기 갈 길이 막혔고
    늙은 처는 얼굴이 쓸쓸
    어린애들은 눈물만 뚝뚝
    허연 살쩍은 천 년 학의 모습
    가련한 생애는 시월의 반딧불
    고마운 당신 은혜 엷지 않으니
    가다가 완적의 눈이 한 번 푸르러지네

  title: Presenting My Petition to an Official
  author: Noh Young-soo
  language: eng
  text: |-
    The official path churns with treacherous waves—
    A struggling fish finds the road ahead blocked.
    My aging wife's face grows hollow with longing,
    My young children weep tears that fall like rain.
    My graying hair resembles a thousand-year crane,
    My remaining days flicker like October fireflies.
    Your kindness, though remembered, weighs heavily upon me—
    Once more my eyes cloud with sorrow's green hue.
