    숙정은 벼슬이 귀하기도 한데
    분사야말로 더욱 청망한 자리
    천 년의 수기를 모아 났으니
    사해가 높은 이름을 감복하네
    백성의 괴로움 물어서 은혜 먼저 베풀고
    죄수를 심문할 제 실정을 살피었네
    거친 고을[郡] 수령인 나는
    안개를 헤쳐 하늘 본 듯 영광스레 기뻐하노니

  title: To the Divided Commissioner Ye Huai on His Inspection Tour
  author: Choi Hae
  language: eng
  text: |-
    The office of Censor is honored and esteemed,
    Yet the divided commissioner's post shines brighter still—
    A thousand years of refined essence gathered in one man,
    The four seas bow to such a lofty name.

    Asking after the people's sorrows, you dispense compassion first,
    Examining the prisoners' cases, you uncover every truth.
    As for me, a rough administrator of a remote prefecture,
    I part the mists and glimpse heaven's light—such radiant joy!
  footnotes:
    - The 'divided commissioner' (分司) was a high-ranking inspector responsible for touring provinces and investigating local governance and corruption.
    - The imagery of 'parting mists' and glimpsing heaven reflects the speaker's sense of being elevated and enlightened by the commissioner's virtuous example.
