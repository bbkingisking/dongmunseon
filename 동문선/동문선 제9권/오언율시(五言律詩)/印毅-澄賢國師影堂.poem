    적막한 늙은 스님의 영정
    누가 알리, 국사이었던
    푸른 이끼가 땅에 깔려 미끄럽고
    낙엽이 계단에 올라 뒹구누나
    이상한 행적은 경종 임금 때라던가
    비석에 새긴 글은 주저의 작이라네
    이 산에 머물기 하도 오랜 세월
    박달나무 전나무들이 늙어 가지 없구나

  title: Portrait Hall of National Master Cheonghyeon
  author: In Ui
  language: eng
  text: |-
    A lonely portrait of an aging monk—
    who recalls he was once a National Master?
    Green moss slicks the ground beneath,
    lost leaves tumble down the stone steps.

    His strange deeds belong to the age of King Gyeongong,
    his memorial stone bears the brush of Jujeok.
    He dwelt upon this mountain through countless years—
    the birch and cypress trees have grown old, their branches bare.
  footnotes:
    - National Master (國師) was a high ecclesiastical rank in Korean Buddhism, indicating Cheonghyeon's distinguished status within the Buddhist order.
    - King Gyeongong reigned during the early Goryeo dynasty (r. 949-975), establishing the historical period of the master's life.
    - Jujeok likely refers to a renowned calligrapher or scholar whose inscription was commissioned for the memorial stone.
