    내 옛날 이 초상을 그려 받을 땐
    푸릇푸릇 두 귀 밑 털에 봄이러니
    이 그림이 몇 해나 여기저기 떠돌았나
    다시금 만나보니 정신 아직 그대로
    이보아, 이 물건이 딴 물건이 아니로세
    어와, 내 전신이 바로 이 후신일세
    아이와 손자들은 보고도 모르겠는지
    날더러 “이게 누구냐” 자꾸 물어보누나

    In days of old, I sat for this portrait,
    When spring still lingered in my dark brows,
    Two temples thick with youth's own verdant hue.

    How many years this image wandered far,
    Passing through countless hands and distant halls,
    Until at last we met again by chance.

    Yet here—the spirit dwells unchanged, unmarred.
    This thing before me is no other thing:
    My former self now stands as latter self.

    Strange how my children and grandchildren gaze
    Upon this face and do not know its truth,
    Asking again and yet again: "But who?"
    Who is this man that time has rendered strange?
  footnotes:
    - This poem is a meditation on a portrait of the poet himself, likely discovered after years of separation. The work explores themes of temporal flux, identity, and the paradox of recognition and estrangement.
    - The phrase '前身' (former body) and '後身' (latter body) carries Buddhist philosophical resonance, suggesting cycles of existence and transformation.
