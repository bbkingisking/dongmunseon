    속객들 아예 못 이르는 곳을
    내 올라오니 마음이 맑아지네
    산 모양은 가을에 더욱 좋을씨고
    강 빛은 밤에 더 환하구나
    흰 새는 훨훨 날아 어디론지 가버리고
    외 배는 살살 혼자 잘도 떠가네
    생각하니 부끄럽구나, 달팽이 뿔 위에서
    반생을 공명 찾으며 허둥지둥 보냈다니

  title: At Gamro Temple, Following the Rhyme of Huiyuan
  author: Kim Bu-sik
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Where the common travelers never venture,
    I climb and find my mind grows clear.
    The mountain's form grows ever fairer
    as autumn deepens its embrace,
    and the river's face shines brighter
    even in the depth of night.

    White birds wheel and disappear
    into distances beyond my knowing,
    while a solitary sail drifts lightly,
    moving with such gentle grace.

    Yet shame fills me as I reflect:
    perched upon a snail's horn,
    I have squandered half my years
    in the vain pursuit of fame and fortune.

  - key: ''
    value: This poem follows the rhyme scheme of a work by the Buddhist monk Huiyuan, a common practice in classical Chinese and Korean poetry. Gamro Temple is located in what is now South Korea. The 'snail's horn' alludes to a famous Chinese parable about the insignificance of human ambitions in the vastness of creation.
