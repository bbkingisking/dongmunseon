    산 비가 길손을 만류하는데
    역정에 해도 거의 저물고
    봄바람을 좋아함도 미워함도 없건만
    물의 성질은 같지 않구나
    버들은 벌써 눈을 곱게 떴고
    꽃 잎술은 기이함을 토하려는데
    어찌하다 내 두 귀밑머리만은
    작년의 하얀 실[絲]들을 못 변하나

  text: |-
    Mountain rain detains the traveler,
    and evening falls upon the post station.
    Spring wind favors nothing, hates nothing—
    yet all things differ in their nature.
    Willow buds already open tenderly,
    flower lips yearn to whisper their strange beauty.
    But why do the silver strands at my temples
    remain unchanged from last year's white?
  footnotes:
    - Anseong Station was a post station along a major travel route in Joseon Korea. The poem contemplates time's passage through the contrast between nature's renewal and the speaker's unchanging age.
    - The image of 'flower lips' (花唇) personifies blossoms as if they were about to speak, capturing the anticipatory beauty of spring.
