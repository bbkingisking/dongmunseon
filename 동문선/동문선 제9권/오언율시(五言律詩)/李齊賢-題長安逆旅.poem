    거마가 들끓는 함곡관(函谷關) 길에
    풍진에 해어진 소계자 갖옷
    수레바퀸 천하의 반을 돌았네
    마음은 물을 따라 동으로 가누나
    만사는 오직 술만 부르고
    천산에 홀로 누에 올랐네
    청운엔 지기 있거니
    어찌 긴 탄식할손가

  text: |-
    Carriages and horses crowd the road through Hanggu Pass,
    A traveler's coat worn threadbare by wind and dust.
    My carriage wheels have traced half the realm,
    Yet my heart drifts eastward with the flowing water.

    Among ten thousand cares, I call only for wine,
    And sit alone upon a terrace high among the mountains.
    But in azure clouds dwell those who know me,
    So why should I surrender to endless sighs?

  - key: ''
    value: The reference to a coat worn by wind and dust evokes the Daoist sage Zhuangzi's wandering philosophy, suggesting the speaker's own restless spiritual journey.
