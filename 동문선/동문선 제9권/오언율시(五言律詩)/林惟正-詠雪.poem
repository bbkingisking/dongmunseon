    듣기도 어여쁘다, 밤새도록 내리는 소리 제기(齊己)
    얇다란 조각이 바람에 쫓겨 하늘하늘 신인손(辛寅遜)
    그윽한 골짝에선 솔 소리와 섞갈리고 노조(盧肇)
    빈 뜰에서는 달빛과 혼동되네 승(僧) 정근(正勤)
    담을 둘러 전부 분을 칠했고 이상은(李商隱)
    나무에 붙으면 모두 꽃이 되는구나 조등(趙膝)
    시인에게 말씀 좀 전해 주게 전기(錢起)
    앞 마을에 가 술 먹을 만하다고 화방(和放)

  title: On Snow
  author: Lim Yu-jeong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Lovely to hear—the sound of snow falling through the night,
    according to Qi Ji.
    Thin fragments chased by wind, dancing lightly,
    says Xin Yin-xun.
    In the secluded ravine it mingles with the whisper of pines,
    Lu Zhao observes.
    In the empty courtyard it blurs with moonlight—
    thus speaks the monk Jing-kun.
    Around the walls, white powder covers all,
    Li Shang-yin notes.
    Where it clings to trees, it becomes flowers entirely,
    Zhao Teng declares.
    Bring word to the poets, I say,
    as Qian Qi would wish.
    That in the village ahead, wine may still be had for credit,
    He Fang concludes.
  footnotes:
    - This poem is composed entirely of allusions to and quotations from famous Chinese poets and Buddhist monks, each attribution noted parenthetically. The work is a sophisticated literary game where the author weaves together multiple poetic voices to create a unified meditation on snow.
    - The shift from sensory impressions (hearing, sight) to the practical concern of obtaining wine at the poem's end reflects a classical move from refined aesthetic appreciation to the humbler realities of human life.
    - The attribution of each line to different poets and monks suggests this may be a collaborative work or a compilation drawing from a shared literary tradition among Korean literati of the period.
