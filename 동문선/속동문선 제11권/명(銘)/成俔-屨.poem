    권문은 불과 같아서
    뛰어들면 열이 나고
    벼슬길은 바다와 같아서
    밟으면 빠지나니
    오직 덕과 의에 있어서는
    삼가서 넘어서지 말라

  title: The Shoe

  text: |-
    The gates of power burn like fire—
    step into them and you shall be scorched.
    The path of office stretches like the sea—
    wade into it and you shall drown.

    Only in virtue and righteousness
    should you tread with care,
    never to stumble or transgress.
  footnotes:
    - The title 'Shoe' (屨) is a metaphor for the path one walks in life, whether through the dangerous corridors of power or the steadfast road of moral conduct.
