    천덕(금(金)의 해릉왕(海陵王) 연호) 당년에 귀밑머리 파란 소년들
    어깨동무로 가는 곳마다 정답게 놀았지
    밤마다 잠들면 백련사 꿈을 꾸었건만
    반생을 황각의 공명에 그르쳤구나
    선정을 파하고 몸 기울이니 솔 사이 흰 달
    재 끝난 뒤 발 씻기는 돌틈의 샘물
    붉은 낙엽으로 절문 앞 길을 봉하지 마소
    벼슬을 내던지는 날 내가 혹시 찾아가리

    In Cheondeok's year, we were young men with dark hair at our temples,
    Walking shoulder to shoulder wherever we went, intimate and carefree.
    Each night in dreams I wandered white lotus halls,
    Yet half my life was lost to yellow pavilion's empty fame.

    Now that I have turned from office, my body bends beneath pine and moon,
    And when my meditation ends, I wash my feet in stone-carved springs.
    Do not let red leaves seal the path before your gate—
    When at last I cast away these robes, perhaps I'll find my way to you.
  footnotes:
    - Cheondeok refers to the reign year of the Jurchen Jin dynasty's Hae-neung Wang, suggesting this poem was written during a period of Jurchen rule or cultural influence.
    - The 'white lotus halls' (白蓮) reference Buddhist temples, symbolizing spiritual aspirations contrasted with worldly ambition.
    - The 'yellow pavilion' (黃閣) represents government office and the pursuit of official rank—a conventional image for worldly success in East Asian poetry.
    - '''Casting away robes'' is a poetic image for renouncing official life and returning to one''s true nature.'
