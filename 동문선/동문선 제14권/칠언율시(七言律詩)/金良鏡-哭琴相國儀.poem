  text: 瑞世文章五色麟。琴碁餘事亦淸眞。九門白日無雙客。十載黃扉只四人。身後淸風千古鏡。手中丹桂萬家春。爲公誰不交揮涕。白髮門生淚滿巾。

    서세의 문장만 오색의 기린이던가
    금기 여사로 청진이라네
    아홉 겹 궐문에 드나든 둘도 없는 손님인데
    10년 간 정승을 누린 이는 오직 네 분이라 하더라
    가신 뒤 남긴 고풍은 천고의 거울이요
    손에 꺾어 쥔 계수는 만가의 봄이었네
    임 위하여 뉘 아니 눈물을 뿌리리요만
    머리 센 문생의 눈물이 수건을 적시네

  title: Elegy for Minister Geum
  author: Kim Yang-gyeong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Was your prose alone the five-colored qilin of a blessed age?
    Your zither and chess—even pastimes touched clarity and truth.
    A visitor unmatched at the nine-fold palace gates,
    yet among those who held the chancellorship for ten years, only four are named.

    After you, the pure wind you left becomes a mirror for ten thousand ages.
    The sweet osmanthus in your hand bloomed as spring for countless homes.
    Who would not shed tears in your honor?
    Yet it is your white-haired student whose tears soak through his cloth.
  footnotes:
    - The 'five-colored qilin' references the legendary auspicious beast associated with sage rulers and virtuous officials in Chinese tradition.
    - The 'nine-fold palace gates' refers to the innermost sanctum of imperial power, suggesting Minister Geum's intimate access to the throne.
    - The 'sweet osmanthus' (桂, gye) symbolizes both official rank and virtue in classical East Asian poetry.
    - The final image of the weeping white-haired student evokes the grief of disciples mourning their mentor's passing.
