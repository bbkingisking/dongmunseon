    우(禹)옛날이라 9년 홍수
    천하가 다 그 난리라
    백성들이 해독을 입어
    어찌할 바를 몰랐나니
    우 임금이 다스리지 안했던들
    우리는 고기가 되었으리
    자기 집 문앞을 세 번이나 지나면서
    태어난 아들이 울어도 사랑하지 못하였네
    백성들의 허덕임이 근심이요
    내 손발 곪아터진 건 괴롬 아닐세
    도랑 쳐서 그 물을 쏟아 내어
    구주가 비로소 흙이 보였네
    백성이 그 은혜 못 잊음은
    어찌 천만 년뿐이리
    장성(공자를 이름)의 하신 말씀
    나는 조금도 의심 없네
    탕(湯)
    아, 크신 천을(탕 임금 이름)이시어
    은나라 상서를 열으셨네
    초야에서 어진 이를 맞아들여
    배우고 또 신하를 삼았구려
    그물 삼 면을 열어 놓으니
    온 천하가 인에 돌아왔네
    낙천하는 뜻으로 갈을 섬기고
    하걸을 쳐서 인심에 순응했네
    그 덕을 밝히지 아니했던들
    어찌 백성에게 믿음을 줄건가
    격언이 여기 있으니
    나날이 새롭게 하고 또 새롭게 하라” 하였네
    문왕(文王)주나라 공을 쌓기는
    저 후직으로부터로세
    서백(문왕)이 발흥하여
    사방의 모범이 되었네
    백이 강자아는 나와서 보호를 받았고
    우와 예는 송사를 바루었네
    주역의 상을 발휘하였고
    송성을 만들어 냈네
    3분의 2를 소유하고도
    섬기기를 허물없이 하였네
    문이 여기에 있지 아니한가
    덕이 그토록 지극하셨네

  title: Three Kings
  author: Lee Je-hyeon

  text: |-
    Yu in ancient days faced the great flood—
    all under heaven drowned in chaos.
    The people suffered the poisoned waters,
    knowing not where to turn.
    Had Yu not mastered what was broken,
    we would have become fish.
    Three times he passed his own house
    without entering, though his son cried within.
    The people's struggle was his worry,
    and his own cracked hands brought no complaint.
    He dug the channels, let the waters flow,
    and the nine regions became solid earth.
    The people have not forgotten his grace—
    why speak merely of ten thousand years?
    The sage once said these words,
    and I harbor no doubt.

    Tang—
    O mighty Heaven's will made manifest!
    Yin rose to glory through your reign.
    You sought the worthy in humble fields,
    learned from them, and made them ministers.
    With net spread open on three sides,
    all the world turned toward benevolence.
    You served Heaven with joy unfeigned,
    and destroyed the tyrant Jie with the people's consent.
    Without revealing your virtue,
    how could the people have given trust?
    This sacred teaching stands:
    "Each day renew yourself, and renew again."

    Wen Wang—
    The Zhou accumulated merit
    since the days of Hou Ji.
    When the Western Earl rose and flourished,
    he became the model for four realms.
    The worthy came forth to serve,
    and disputes were justly resolved.
    He unfolded the symbols of the I Ching,
    and brought forth songs of praise.
    With only two-thirds of the land in hand,
    yet served the Shang without failing in duty.
    Is this not the very essence of culture?
    His virtue reached its pinnacle.
  footnotes:
    - Yu the Great (禹) is legendary for spending thirteen years controlling the Great Flood, working so tirelessly that he passed his own home three times without entering to see his newborn son.
    - Tang (湯) was the founder of the Shang Dynasty, known for his benevolence and for overthrowing the tyrannical Xia ruler Jie.
    - Wen Wang (文王) was the father of the founder of the Zhou Dynasty. Though he ruled only two-thirds of the land, he maintained loyalty to the declining Shang, exemplifying virtue.
    - The phrase 'Each day renew yourself, and renew again' comes from the I Ching and reflects the Confucian emphasis on continuous moral self-cultivation.
