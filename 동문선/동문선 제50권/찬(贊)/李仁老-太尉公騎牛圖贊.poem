    장자방은 유후로 봉하게 되자
    적송자를 따라가 노닐었고
    도주공(범려)은 월나라의 정승인데
    배를 타고 오호로 떠나갔네
    마음은 기교가 없으니
    해객의 갈매기를 친할 수 있고
    족적은 속세와 혼동하여
    노군의 소를 탈 수 있네
    뇌전을 문석에 무릅써도
    그 낯빛을 변하지 아니하고
    음양을 금현에 섭리하여
    모두 그 은택을 입었지만
    그 덕에 비하면 한 털끝이거늘
    세상이 어찌 알리오
    생초비단 한 번 펴 보니
    얼음인 양 눈인 양 맑고도 늠름하네

  title: Eulogy on the Grand Commander Riding an Ox
  author: Lee In-ro
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Zhang Liang received his fief at Liu,
    and wandered with the Red Pine Master.
    Tao Zhu, minister of Yue,
    set sail upon the Five Lakes.

    With a mind free from cunning,
    he could befriend the sea-gull of the wanderer.
    With traces mingled in the mundane world,
    he could ride the ox of the Old Lord.

    Though thunder strikes the marble stone,
    his countenance does not change.
    Though he regulates yin and yang with the golden strings,
    all receive his grace—
    yet compared to his virtue,
    this is but a hair's breadth.
    How could the world comprehend this?

    Unfurl raw silk once,
    and see it—crystalline as ice and snow,
    so pure, so noble and serene.
  footnotes:
    - Zhang Liang and Tao Zhu (Tao Zhugong) were legendary recluses of ancient China who withdrew from court after accomplishing their duties. The reference suggests a parallel between their spiritual transcendence and the subject's elevated character.
    - The Red Pine Master (赤松子) and the Old Lord (老君, Laozi) represent Daoist immortals and sages, embodying freedom from worldly attachment.
    - The Five Lakes represents a place of retreat and contemplation, associated with Tao Zhu's famous escape from court.
    - Raw silk (生綃) refers to the ox painting itself, suggesting that seeing the image itself is sufficient to perceive the subject's sublime virtue.
