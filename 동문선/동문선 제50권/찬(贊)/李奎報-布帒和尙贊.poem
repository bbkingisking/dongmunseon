    배가 크고 처졌으니
    담은 것이 무엇인가
    눈썹을 붙이고 앉았으니
    사색인가 상상인가
    주머니는 차서 무거우니
    싸놓은 것이 어찌 그리 많은가
    장차 시방세계
    일체의 동물을 총괄하여
    담은 것과 싸놓은 것으로
    베풀어 주고 건져 줄 터이니
    생각이 여기 있어
    눈 감고 상상하며 사색하는가

  title: In Praise of the Monk with the Cloth Sack
  author: Lee Gyeong-bo
  language: eng
  text: |-
    His belly swells and sags—
    what treasures does he hold?
    Eyebrows knit in meditation as he sits—
    is it contemplation or imagination?

    His sack is full and heavy—
    what abundance does he hoard?
    Soon he will embrace all ten directions,
    all sentient creatures, foolish and wise alike,
    scattering what he has gathered,
    delivering what he has stored.

    Thinking arrives at this moment—
    with eyes closed, does he dream and ponder?

    value: The phrase 'ten directions' (시방) refers to all directions in space—a traditional Buddhist expression encompassing the entire universe.
  - key: ''
    value: The poem plays on paradoxes of emptiness and fullness, outer form and inner spiritual reality, characteristic of Zen Buddhist poetry.
