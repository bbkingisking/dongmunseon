    공(公)공정하면 사사롭지 않다
    마음이 맑아 욕심 없고
    행사는 지당하게 된다
    이것을 정직이라 하느니라
    근(勤)근하면 게으르지 않다
    부지런히 하여 허물짓지 않으면
    직무를 폐기할 까닭도 없다
    이것을 충현이라 하느니라
    관(寬)너그러우면 가혹함이 없어
    일마다 인후할 것이다
    군자의 덕이니
    경사가 훗날까지 미치느니라
    신(信)미덥게 하면 허망하지 않나니
    가지기를 지성으로 하라
    그 뜻을 굳게 지켜
    스스로 변경하지 말라

  title: Four-Character Teachings Inscribed and Presented to My Son, the Lord of Gilcheon
  author: Gwon Geun

    Impartiality—when the heart is just, it harbors no selfish desire.
    The mind grows clear, free from craving,
    and all deeds flow from rightness itself.
    This is what we call Integrity.

    Diligence—when effort is constant, laziness finds no purchase.
    With earnest application, faults are prevented,
    and duties never fall to ruin.
    This is what we call Loyalty and Virtue.

    Generosity—when the heart is broad, harshness dissolves.
    All affairs become touched by benevolence,
    becoming the virtue of the noble man,
    and blessings flow down through generations yet unborn.

    Trustworthiness—when faith is true, falsehood cannot take hold.
    Hold fast to sincerity,
    keep steadfast your purpose,
    and never alter your path by your own hand.
