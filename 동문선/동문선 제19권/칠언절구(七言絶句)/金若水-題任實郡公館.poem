    늙은 나무 거친 개암 옛 개울을 덮고
    집집마다 나물로도 오히려 배 못 불리네
    산새는 군수의 백성 걱정한 뜻을 모르고
    그저 숲 사이에서 마음대로 지저귀네

  title: Written at the Residence of the Magistrate of Imsil
  author: Kim Yak-su
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Old trees and wild hazels line the ancient pathways,
    Yet in every home, wild greens alone cannot fill hungry bellies.
    The mountain birds know nothing of the magistrate's concern for his people—
    They simply sing freely among the forest trees.
  footnotes:
    - Imsil was a county in Jeolla Province during the Joseon period. This poem appears to have been written as a commentary on the poverty and hardship of the local residents during the poet's visit.
    - The contrast between nature's indifference (the birds singing freely) and human suffering reflects a common theme in Korean classical poetry—the tension between the natural world's apparent harmony and the struggles of common people.
