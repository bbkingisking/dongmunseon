    9월 십일이라, 가을향긴 아직도 쇠하지 않았기에
    높은 데 올라가 함께 잔을 기울이려 했네
    예 놀던 친구는 이제 없어졌으니
    홀로 국화만이 아직도 울타리에 가득하구나

  title: On the Tenth Day, Wishing to Invite Hansangseo to Drink Together, Upon Hearing of His Passing
  author: Jung Seup-myeong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    The tenth day of autumn—fragrance not yet faded away.
    I climbed the heights, hoping we'd tilt our cups as one.
    But my old companions of those pleasures exist no more.
    Only the chrysanthemums remain, still heavy on the fence.
  footnotes:
  - key: ''
    value: The poem plays on the traditional practice of celebrating the Ninth Day of the Ninth Month (Double Ninth Festival) by ascending heights and sharing wine, a convention rich in Chinese and Korean literary tradition. The speaker's invitation comes on the tenth day—just beyond the proper observance—emphasizing both the missed opportunity and the continuity of natural beauty despite human loss.
  - key: ''
    value: Chrysanthemums (국화) are symbols of longevity and steadfastness in East Asian poetry, making their persistence particularly poignant against the speaker's solitude and the absence of his friend.
