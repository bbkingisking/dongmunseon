    용만이 휘도는 곳 보주성이라
    말 위에서 멀리 바라보니 눈이 더욱 밝고나
    보배롭다 통군봉 한 떨기여
    강을 격해 분주히 웃으며 맞아주네

  title: Commander's Peak

  text: |-
    Where the Dragon Bay curves, there stands Bozhou City.
    From horseback, gazing far, my eyes grow ever clearer.
    How precious, Commander's Peak, that single bloom—
    Across the river it rushes forth with laughter to greet me.
  footnotes:
    - Commander's Peak (統軍峯) is a notable geographical landmark located west of the Yalu River, likely in the Bozhou area of Manchuria.
    - The poem employs the conceit of the mountain as an active greeter, personifying the landscape's welcome to the speaker.
