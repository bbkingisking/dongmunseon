    석양에 서서 읊조리니 생각이 그지없다
    만고 강산이 한 눈 속에 드는구나
    태수가 백성을 근심하여 잔치놀이에 마음 두지 않으니
    강에 가득 저 풍월이 어옹 차질세

  title: The Pavilion of Poyang in Raozhou
  author: Choi Chi-won
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Standing in the evening sun, I recite and ponder—
    thoughts endless as the flowing stream.
    Ten thousand ages of mountains and rivers
    fall into the span of a single gaze.
    The prefect, burdened with care for his people,
    turns away from feasts and idle pleasures.
    The wind and moon fill the river—
    they belong to the fisherman's heart.
  footnotes:
  - key: ''
    value: Poyang Lake (鄱陽) is located in present-day Jiangxi Province. The poem reflects the author's meditation on governance and the natural world during his travels.
  - key: ''
    value: The contrast between the prefect's austere concern for the people and the fisherman's freedom suggests the poet's own philosophical tension between official duty and reclusive contemplation.
