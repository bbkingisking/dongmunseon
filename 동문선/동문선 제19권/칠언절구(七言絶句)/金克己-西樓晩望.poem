    강바람 살랑살랑 봄 풀섶을 스치는데
    변방의 해는 어스름히 늦은 하늘에 누웠네
    물빛은 하늘에 닿고 연기는 땅을 덮으니
    나무꾼 길 낚시 여울은 보일 듯 말 듯

  title: Evening View from the Western Tower
  author: Kim Geuk-gi
  language: eng
  text: |-
    The river wind whispers softly through the spring thickets,
    While the border sun grows dim, resting in the evening sky.
    Water's hue merges with heaven, mist blankets the earth—
    The woodcutter's path and fishing shallows hover between being and void.
  footnotes:
    - The 'Western Tower' (西樓) suggests a vantage point of contemplation, possibly on the frontier or boundary between civilizations, reflecting the poet's position observing the liminal space between day and night, earth and sky.
    - The final couplet's ambiguity—'보일 듯 말 듯' (appearing yet disappearing)—captures a moment where human traces in nature become indistinct, suggesting the transience of human activity within the vast natural world.
