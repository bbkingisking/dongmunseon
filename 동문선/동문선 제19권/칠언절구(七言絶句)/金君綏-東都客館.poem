    무열왕 왕손이요 문열공 집이라
    계림의 진골 자랑할 만 않으랴
    고향은 하늘 동쪽에 있었더니
    이제 다행히 사신 되어 와서 노네

  title: The Guest House of the Eastern Capital
  author: Kim Gun-su

  text: |-
    Descendant of the Martial King, heir to Minister Munryeol's house,
    A true bone of Gyerim—why should I not take pride?
    My homeland remains in heaven's eastern corner,
    Yet here I am, fortunate to have come as an envoy, wandering free.
  footnotes:
    - Gyerim (鷄林) is an ancient name for the Korean kingdom of Silla, from which the true bone (真骨) aristocratic class emerged.
    - The 'Martial King' (武烈王) and 'Minister Munryeol' (文烈公) likely refer to illustrious ancestors in the poet's lineage.
    - The poem plays on the tension between the poet's nostalgic attachment to his distant homeland and his present status as an envoy at the court.
