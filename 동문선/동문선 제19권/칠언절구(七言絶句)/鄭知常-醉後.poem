    복사꽃 붉은 비에 새들이 지저귀니
    집을 둘러싼 청산에는 푸른 이내 아른거리네
    이마에 비스듬한 오사모 게으른 탓이어니
    취하여 꽃동산에 누워 강남을 꿈꾸네

  text: |-
    Pink peach blossoms fall like rain, and birds chirp their gentle song.
    Green mountains encircle my home, their slopes hazed in tender mist.
    My black silk cap sits askew upon my brow—
    laziness wins the day.
    Drunk, I rest among the flowers and dream of the south.
  footnotes:
    - The 'black silk cap' (烏紗) is a traditional official's hat, suggesting the speaker's rank or past position, making the lazy intoxication all the more poignant as an escape from duty.
    - 江南 (Gangnam/the south) represents a place of beauty and longing in classical poetry, often symbolizing either a beloved land or an idealized realm of leisure and pleasure.
