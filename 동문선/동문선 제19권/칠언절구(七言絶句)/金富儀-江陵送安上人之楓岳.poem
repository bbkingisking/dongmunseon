    강릉 날씨 따사로와 꽃이 먼저 피는데
    풍악 하늘 추운지라 눈이 아직 안 녹았으리
    돌이키니 상인의 산수벽 아직도
    아무데서나 소요하지 못함이 우습고나

  title: Seeing Off Buddhist Monk An to Mount Pungak from Gangneung
  author: Kim Bu-ui
  language: eng
  text: |-
    At Gangneung the sun warms and flowers bloom early,
    Yet at Mount Pungak the sky stays cold, snow lingers still.
    I turn to laugh at the monk's obsession with mountains and streams—
    He cannot find his ease and wandering anywhere he goes.
