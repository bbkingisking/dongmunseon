    고을 성 남쪽 기슭에 물이 무궁하여
    굽은 길 부교가 막혔다가 다시 통하네
    이 몸이 어찌 구속을 벗어나
    편주로 한 강바람에 나부낄꼬

  title: At Huxin Temple in Mingzhou, Following the Rhyme of the Director of Documents
  author: Kim Bu-sik
  language: eng
  text: |-
    South of the district town, water stretches without end,
    Winding paths and floating bridges—blocked, then open again.
    How can this body escape the bonds that confine it?
    In a small boat, I would drift upon the river wind.
  footnotes:
    - Huxin Temple (湖心寺) was a renowned Buddhist temple in Mingzhou (明州), located in what is now Zhejiang Province, China. The poem's setting evokes both physical and spiritual freedom.
    - The 'Director of Documents' (書狀官) refers to an official to whose rhyme scheme the poet is responding, a common practice in classical East Asian poetry.
