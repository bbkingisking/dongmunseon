    첩첩한 돌 사이에 미친 듯이 내뿜어 겹겹 봉우리에 울리니
    사람 말소리 지척에서 분간하기 어렵네
    항상 시비하는 소리 귀에 들림을 두려워 하기에
    짐짓 흐르는 물을 시켜 온 산을 둘러싸네

  title: On the Reading Hall at Mount Gaya
  author: Choi Chi-won
  language: eng
  text: |-
    The torrent roars through stacked stones, crying out across layered peaks,
    Human voices blur to nothing within arm's reach.
    Fearing the sounds of dispute might drift to my ear,
    I bid the flowing waters to embrace the entire mountain.
  footnotes:
    - Mount Gaya (Gaya-san) in southern Korea was a famous site for Buddhist temples and scholarly retreats during the Silla period. Choi Chi-won, a celebrated scholar-official and poet of late Silla, built a reading hall there to escape worldly distractions.
    - The poem employs water as a metaphorical boundary between the scholar's retreat and the mundane world of human conflict and gossip.
