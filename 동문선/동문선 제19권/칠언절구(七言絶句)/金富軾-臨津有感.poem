    가을바람 산들산들 물은 출렁출렁
    장교에 머리 돌리니 생각이 아득해라
    슬프다, 고운 사람 천리를 격했는데
    강변의 향기로운 풀 누굴 위해 향기롭노

  title: Reflections at the Imjin River
  author: Kim Bu-sik
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Autumn wind whispers soft and low, the waters ripple and sway.
    Turning back toward the long bridge, my thoughts dissolve into distance.
    Ah, the sorrow—my beloved is separated by a thousand miles,
    and the fragrant grasses on the river's shore perfume the air for whom?
  footnotes:
    - The Imjin River (臨津) is a river in the Korean peninsula, historically significant as a boundary. This poem likely reflects on separation across the river, a common theme in East Asian poetry representing both literal and emotional distance.
    - The fragrant grasses (蘭芷) are classical symbols of virtue and beauty in Chinese poetry tradition, here used to evoke the absent beloved.
