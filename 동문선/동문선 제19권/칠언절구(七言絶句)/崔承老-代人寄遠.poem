    가는 수레 한 번 작별한 뒤 해가 격하였네
    다락에 기대어 바라보고자 오르기에 몇 번이나 수고로웠나
    상사의 괴로움 비록 이와 같을지라도
    원하지 않네, 공 없이 빨리 돌아오는 것을

  title: On Behalf of One Sending Word to a Distant Beloved
  author: Choe Seung-ro
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Since the chariot departed, a year has passed in separation.
    How many times I have climbed the tower, leaning on the rail, to gaze toward him.
    Though my heart aches with longing,
    I do not wish for him to return empty-handed, rushing back too soon.
  footnotes:
    - This poem adopts the voice of a woman waiting for her beloved, likely a soldier or official on an expedition. The 'chariot' (征車) suggests a military or official journey.
    - The tower imagery conveys the classical pose of the waiting beloved—a common motif in East Asian poetry symbolizing patient devotion and the passage of time.
    - 'The final couplet reveals the speaker''s noble sentiment: though she suffers from separation, she prioritizes her beloved''s success and honor over her own comfort, refusing to wish for his hasty return without accomplishment.'
