    험한 것 겪으면서 태화봉 오르려 했더니
    돌아올 길 붉은 저녁 볕 도리어 겁났네
    우연히 나랏일로 방외에 노니
    도리어 부끄럽고나 당년의 양차공이

    Through perils I sought to scale the heights of Taehwa Peak,
    Yet on the return path, the crimson sunset made me hesitate.
    By chance, royal duties drew me to wander beyond the world,
    And I find myself ashamed, remembering Yang Cigung of old.
