    자다가 일어나 옛 벗을 생각하고
    머리 들어 송산을 바라보네
    맑은 바람은 불어서 다하지 않거니
    흰 구름에 마음이 절로 한가하구나

  title: A Letter to the Venerable Cheong at Geumjong Temple
  author: Gwak Gyun
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Waking from sleep, I think of an old friend,
    I lift my head and gaze toward Pine Mountain.
    The clear wind blows on without end,
    And my heart grows naturally idle in the white clouds.
  footnotes:
    - Pine Mountain (松山) likely refers to a specific sacred mountain near Geumjong Temple, a place of spiritual significance.
    - The poem contrasts the restless act of remembrance with the natural tranquility found in contemplating landscape, suggesting that connection with nature may transcend the distance between distant friends.
