    강호의 기약을 오랫동안 저버린 채
    풍진에 어느덧 이십 년일세
    백구도 조롱하는 듯
    짐짓 다락 앞으로 가까이 오네

  text: |-
    For twenty years I've wandered through dust and wind,
    broken my promise to return to river and lake.
    Even the white gulls seem to mock me now—
    they drift so close before my tower, as if to laugh.

  - key: ''
    value: The white gull is a traditional symbol in East Asian poetry of freedom, purity, and the untamed spirit—here used ironically as a witness to the speaker's compromised state.
