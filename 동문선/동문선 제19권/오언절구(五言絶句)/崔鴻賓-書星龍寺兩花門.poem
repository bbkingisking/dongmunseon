    고목은 삭풍에 울고
    잔잔한 물결 위에 저녁볕이 일렁인다
    배회하면서 옛일을 생각하노니
    눈물이 옷을 적심을 깨닫지 못하네

    Ancient trees cry out in the winter wind.
    Gentle ripples shimmer with the fading light.
    As I wander and ponder what has passed,
    I do not notice the tears that wet my robe.
  footnotes:
    - Seongryong Temple was a notable Buddhist temple in medieval Korea, and the Two Flower Gate (Yangwhamun) refers to its main entrance gate.
