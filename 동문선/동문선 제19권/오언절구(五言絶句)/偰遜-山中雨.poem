    하룻밤 산중의 비에
    바람이 지붕의 떼를 걷어 갔네
    개울물이 불은 것은 알지 못하고
    다만 낚싯배가 높아진 줄 깨닫네

  title: Rain in the Mountains
  author: Seol Sun

  text: |-
    One night, rain falls in the mountains.
    Wind sweeps away the thatch upon the roof.
    I cannot tell how much the creek has swollen—
    Only that my fishing boat has risen higher.
  footnotes:
  - key: ''
    value: 'The poet observes the mountain rain''s effects indirectly: the displacement of his boat serves as the measure of the rising waters, a subtle commentary on the limits of direct perception and the poet''s humble engagement with nature.'
