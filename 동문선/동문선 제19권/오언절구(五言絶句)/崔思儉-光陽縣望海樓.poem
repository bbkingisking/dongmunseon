    하늘이 머니 구름 돛폭은 작고
    바람이 가벼우니 보리 물결이 번뜩인다
    공사의 여가에 한 번 다락에 올라
    느껴워라 임금 은혜 머리를 조아리네

  title: Looking to the Sea from the Tower at Gwangyang County
  author: Choi Sa-geom
  language: eng
  text: |-
    The heavens stretch distant, and the clouded sails grow small.
    The wind blows gentle, and the barley waves shimmer.
    In the leisure hours of office, I climb this tower once,
    And bowing my head, I feel the boundless grace of my sovereign.
  footnotes:
    - The tower overlooks both agricultural lands and the sea, representing the poet's dual awareness of both his earthly duties and his gratitude to the throne.
    - The image of small sails and rippling barley fields suggests a landscape of commerce and sustenance, through which the poet perceives the order and benevolence of royal rule.
