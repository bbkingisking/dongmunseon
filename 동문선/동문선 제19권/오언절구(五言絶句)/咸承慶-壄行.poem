    맑은 새벽에 해가 장차 뜨려 하니
    구름과 노을빛이 눈부시구나
    강산이 더욱 기절하니
    이 늙은이 시를 못 짓네

  title: Night Journey
  author: Ham Seung-gyeong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    At clear dawn, the sun begins to rise,
    Clouds and rosy light scatter in splendor.
    The rivers and mountains grow ever more transcendent—
    Yet this old man cannot compose a poem.
  footnotes:
    - The title 'Night Journey' (야행) refers to travel or wandering through the landscape, though the poem itself depicts dawn rather than night, suggesting the poet's journey through life and perception.
    - The final line carries a note of humility common in classical East Asian poetry, where the poet acknowledges the inadequacy of words before nature's grandeur.
