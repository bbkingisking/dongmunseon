    손을 씻을 맑은 샘이 차고
    몸을 덮어 줄 무성한 나무가 높다
    관동이 와서 글자를 물으니
    가히 더불어 소요할 만하구나

  title: On the Immediate
  author: Gil Jae

  text: |-
    Clear spring water, cold for washing hands,
    Tall verdant trees to shelter this weary frame.
    A young scholar arrives asking about the characters,
    And now I have a companion for my wandering.
