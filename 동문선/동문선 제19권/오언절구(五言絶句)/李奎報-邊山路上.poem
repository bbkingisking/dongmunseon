    정기는 손의 길을 빛내고
    고각은 사람 마음을 장하게 하네
    들쥐는 대숲에 뛰어들어 숨는데
    놀랜 노루는 숲을 찾아 달아나네

  title: On the Mountain Border Road
  author: Lee Gyeongbo
  language: eng
  text: |-
    The banners gleam along the traveler's path,
    Drums and horns steel the warrior's heart.
    Wild rats dart and hide in the bamboo thicket,
    Startled deer bound away, seeking the forest.
  footnotes:
    - The 'mountain border road' likely refers to a frontier route during Korea's medieval period, suggesting a military or official journey. The poem contrasts human martial readiness with the instinctive fear of small creatures disturbed by the military procession.
