    집 뒤 뽕나무 가지 고운 새싹 트고
    서쪽 언덕맡에 무추잎 빼어나네
    봄물이 못에 넘치니
    아이놈들 배를 저을 줄 아네

    Behind the house, tender shoots crown the mulberry branches,
    West of the garden beds, wild garlic leaves unfurl their grace.
    Spring waters brim and overflow the pond—
    And now the children know to pole their little boats.
  footnotes:
    - This poem celebrates simple rural contentment, depicting the arrival of spring and the innocent pleasures of country life. The progression from natural imagery to human activity suggests a harmonious connection between nature's abundance and daily existence.
