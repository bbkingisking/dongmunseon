    무시 이래로부터
    나고 죽기 몇 번이나 돌고 돌았는고
    옆의 사람은 응당 냉시하려니
    늙은 이 몸은 마음이 재와 같네

    Since the beginning of time,
    I have circled through birth and death—
    how many times, who can say?

    Others look upon me with cold eyes,
    yet this aging frame
    has a heart turned to ash.
  footnotes:
    - Hongzhou (洪州) was a historical region in present-day Jiangxi Province, China, suggesting the poem may have been written during a sojourn or exile there.
    - The imagery of a heart 'turned to ash' reflects Buddhist and Daoist concepts of spiritual detachment and the dissolution of worldly attachments through the cycles of rebirth.
