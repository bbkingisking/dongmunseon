  title: 돌의 굳음은 빼앗을 수 없다
  author: 김양경
  language: kor
  text: |-
    음양이 처음 갈라진 뒤에
    우주 안에 물건이 만 가지로되
    돌은 그 속에 바탕을 가져
    사람이 밖에서 굳음 못 뺏네
    쳐부술 수는 있을지언정
    본성은 타고난 대로 잃지 않나니
    형체는 만들어진 것
    하늘에서 받은 것은 옮길 수 없네
    쇠는 녹아 그릇 됨이 부끄러운 일
    구리 부어 돈이 됨도 창피한 것
    절개 있는 선비가 바로 돌이니
    그 마음, 그 줏대를 누가 옮기리

  title: The Stone's Firmness Cannot Be Taken
  author: Kim Yang-gyeong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    After Yin and Yang first divided the world,
    A myriad of things scattered through the cosmos—
    The stone alone harbors something unchanging within,
    No hand from without can steal its steadfastness.

    Strike it, yes, and it may shatter,
    Yet its nature remains true to what it was born to be.
    Its form was made by the earth's offering,
    What heaven granted cannot be moved.

    Iron bows its head, melted into vessels—
    Ashamed to serve such transformation.
    Copper pours forth, forged into coins—
    Dishonored by such purpose.

    But the noble scholar is like stone:
    Who could ever bend his resolve,
    Who could ever sway his unwavering spirit?
  footnotes:

    value: The poem employs stone as a metaphor for the unchanging moral integrity of the virtuous person, contrasting it with metals that can be melted and reshaped into different forms, symbolizing compromise and moral flexibility.
