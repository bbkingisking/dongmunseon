  title: A Memorial on the Conduct of the Grand Empress Dowager
  author: Lee O
  language: eng
  text: Dwelling in the eastern borderlands, I cannot join the ranks of those who serve at court. Yet with earnest reverence, I gaze toward the inner palace, and can only sing the praises of her gentle and luminous virtue.
  footnotes:
    - The 'eastern borderlands' refers to the author's remote posting, emphasizing his distance from the capital and the court. The 'inner palace' (內朝) refers to the seat of the Grand Empress Dowager's authority. 'Gentle and luminous virtue' (柔明之德) is a classical phrase describing the feminine ideal of wisdom and benevolence.
