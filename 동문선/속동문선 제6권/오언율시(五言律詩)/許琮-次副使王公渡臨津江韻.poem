    새 그림자는 구름 낀 물가에 잠기고
    조수 소리는 바닷물에 숨는도다
    멀리서 오는 바람 야마(아지랭이)를 때리는데
    비 개인 날에 하돈(복생선)이 모여드네
    나그네 길은 산이 연달으고
    떠나는 정은 술이 한 단지
    강 건너 의심스레 바라보는 곳
    꽃과 버들 두어 집 마을일세

  title: Matching the Rhyme as Vice-Envoy Wang Crosses the Imjin River
  author: Heo Jong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Bird shadows sink into the clouded shore,
    Tidal sounds are swallowed by the sea gate.
    Distant wind strikes the shimmering heat,
    On clear days river fish gather in schools.

    The traveler's path winds through a thousand peaks,
    Parting sorrow drowns in a single cup of wine.
    Across the river, in that uncertain gaze,
    A village of a few houses wrapped in flowers and willows.
  footnotes:
    - The Imjin River (臨津江) marks the border between ancient Korean kingdoms and was an important crossing point.
    - The 'heat' (야마) refers to the shimmering distortion visible above hot ground or water on clear days.
    - This poem was composed to match the rhyme scheme of Vice-Envoy Wang's original work, a common poetic practice among literati.
