    찬 비는 국화에 좋지 않은데
    술 항아리 작으매 가까운 사람 안다
    문을 닫고 있노니 단풍잎 지고
    시를 얻고 나니 흰 머리 새로워라
    정든 친한 벗을 즐거이 생각나니
    시름은 적막한 새벽에 더해진다
    언제나 푸른 눈(정다운 표정)으로 마주 앉아서
    한 벗 웃으며 따뜻한 봄을 본다

  title: Reflections in the Rain, Choosing from Among Them
  author: Park Eun
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Cold rain is unkind to chrysanthemums.
    A small cup of wine reveals who truly draws near.
    Behind closed doors, crimson leaves descend.
    With a poem gained, white hair seems born anew.

    I recall with joy the friends I hold dear,
    Yet sorrow deepens in the desolate dawn.
    When shall we meet again with gentle eyes,
    And laugh together to see spring's warm return?
  footnotes:
    - The chrysanthemum traditionally symbolizes resilience and endurance through hardship in East Asian poetry; here, the cold rain suggests that even steadfast things suffer in bleakness.
    - The small cup of wine is a common image in classical Chinese and Korean poetry representing intimate fellowship and honest companionship.
    - White hair appearing anew through poetry suggests a paradoxical renewal—aging combined with artistic creation bringing fresh vitality to life.
