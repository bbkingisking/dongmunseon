    매실은 오늘의 비를 맞이하는데
    보리는 고향의 가을을 보내오네
    돌아가기 좋음을 잘 알거니
    어찌 벼슬 시름을 견딜 것인가
    강산은 한 쌍의 밀납신이요
    천지는 하나의 고기잡이 배일세
    언제나 고향에 돌아가려나
    나는 어젯밤 꿈속에서 놀았노라

    The plum blossoms greet today's rain,
    While barley waves send autumn from my native place.
    I know well how sweet it is to return home—
    How can I bear the sorrows of official life?

    The rivers and mountains: a pair of waxen boots,
    Heaven and earth: a lone fishing boat.
    When shall I journey back?
    I spent last night wandering through my dreams.
  footnotes:
    - The plum and barley are seasonal markers that evoke the passing of time and the rhythm of rural life, contrasting with the speaker's present duties.
    - Waxen boots and a fishing boat are metaphors for the simple, unburdened existence the poet longs for in his retirement.
    - The final couplet shifts from interrogation to intimate reflection, as the speaker acknowledges that his return exists only in the realm of dreams.
