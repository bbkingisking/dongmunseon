    손꼽아 보면 임신년인데
    서로 사귄지 10년이 넘었다
    죽림이란 절에서 비둘기를 쏘았고
    율정 빈 터에서 말을 달렸다
    멀리 귀양 왔으매 그 누가 나를 알리
    같이 읊다가 그대 나를 일으켰다
    한 병 술의 정도 옅지 않거니
    하물며 맛난 생선마저 있음에랴

  title: A Gift for Jungjeol
  author: Kim Maengseong

    Counting on my fingers, it has been the year of Imsin—
    over ten years now since we first became friends.
    We shot at clay pigeons in the temple groves,
    raced our horses through the ruins of Yuljeong.

    Exiled to this distant place, who would have known me?
    Yet you, rising to join my song,
    lifted my spirit high.

    A single cup of wine already speaks of bonds so deep—
    how much more so when shared with fine fish and good company?
