    중양은 좋은 시절
    산수는 강남에서 절경이라
    만리에 구름 한 점 없고
    작은 배로 밝은 달을 희롱한다
    군옥봉을 찾아 갔다가
    우연히 갈대 꽃 눈 속으로 들어갔다
    밤이 깊어서 돌아 가려 하니
    돛대 노래 슬프고 또 목메이는구나

    Autumn's Double Ninth arrives, that finest season—
    The waters and mountains of Jiangnan shine with beauty beyond compare.
    Across ten thousand leagues, not a wisp of cloud mars the sky.
    In my small boat, I tease the bright moon with my paddle.

    Searching for the Jade Peaks among the gathering peaks,
    I wander by chance into reeds like snow blossoms.
    When deep night falls and I think to turn homeward,
    My boatman's song grows sorrowful, his voice catches and breaks.
