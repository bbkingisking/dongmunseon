  text: 溪花處處發。溪水曲曲淸。花發惜年華。水淸宜濯纓。睠言詩書地。悠悠櫂歌聲。千年武夷詩。懷哉考亭名。高蹈繼前轍。寧負平生盟。歲晚此翺翔。梅竹冰雪明。

    시내 꽃은 곳곳에 피고
    시내 물은 굽이굽이 맑도다
    꽃이 피니 세월 가는 것이 아깝고
    물이 맑으니 갓끈 빨기에 마땅하도다
    시서를 강론하던 땅에
    유유히 돛대 노랫소리가 들리는 듯
    천 년의 무이시는
    고정(주자 (朱子))의 이름이 그리워라
    고도하여 전철을 계승할 것이니
    어찌 평생의 맹세를 저버리랴
    해 늦게 방황하니
    매화와 대에 얼음과 눈이 밝도다

  title: Sending Off a Friend with a Poem on the Nine Bends of the Stream
  author: Seok Hongryeon
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Stream flowers bloom abundantly everywhere,
    Stream water winds clear through every turn.
    As flowers open, I grieve the passing years,
    As waters clear, they call for washing the silk cord of my cap.
    In lands where poetry and books were once debated,
    I hear the oars singing, drifting on and on.
    A thousand years have passed since the Wuyi poems—
    How I long for the name of Kaoting, the sage.
    Walking high, I follow in the footsteps of old masters,
    How could I betray the vows of a lifetime?
    As the year grows late, I wander here,
    Where plum blossoms and bamboo gleam bright with ice and snow.
  footnotes:
    - Kaoting refers to Zhu Xi (朱子), the great Song Dynasty neo-Confucian philosopher who lived in the Wuyi Mountains and conducted his philosophical teachings there. The Nine Bends (Jiuqu/구곡) of the stream are associated with this sacred landscape.
    - The 'silk cord' (纓) of the scholar's cap is a symbol of the scholar's dignity and moral integrity in classical Chinese culture.
    - The poem employs the imagery of the changing seasons and the enduring natural landscape to reflect on the continuity of scholarly and moral traditions across centuries.
