  text: 경계가 달라서 비록 거주지가 천 리에 한정되었으나, 성신(聖神)이 작흥(作興)하여 한 때에 같이 만나게 된 것이 기쁩니다. 봉장(封章)을 대궐에 바치게 됨에 행리(行李)가 귀지(貴地)를 경유할 듯하여 드디어 문안의 서신을 드리며 기체가 평안하시기를 빕니다.

  text: |-
    Though boundaries divide us and our homes are separated by a thousand li,
    when the sage and divine work their will,
    we rejoice to meet in a single moment.

    As sealed memorials reach the imperial gates,
    the messenger's path winds through those honored lands.
    Thus I send this letter of inquiry,
    hoping to bring tidings of your peaceful days.
  footnotes:
    - The 'sage and divine' (聖神) likely refers to the ruler whose will brings separated officials or scholars together despite distance.
    - The 'sealed memorials' (封章) represent official documents being presented to the court, suggesting the speaker's journey or communication is official in nature.
    - 'The poem employs a common trope of Korean Neo-Confucian verse: expressing joy at unexpected communion across physical separation through providential or political circumstance.'
