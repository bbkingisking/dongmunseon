  text: 인통(人統)이 바야흐로 돌아옴에 첫봄이 비로소 열렸는데 사화(使華)는 멀리 계시어 친히 수주(壽酒)를 올리지 못합니다. 삼가 생각건대, 안부상공(按部相公)은 국량이 활달하고 풍신이 뛰어나며, 수레에 올라 시찰함에 위엄이 지방에 떨치고, 새 책력을 비로소 반포함에 경사는 막부(幕府)에 모입니다. 모(某) 등은 외람되이 한 지방을 맡아 다스림에 어지신 성화를 접하게 되었으나, 다만 몸이 직무에 얽매여서 존전(尊前)에 나아가 수종을 들지 못합니다.

  title: Congratulations to Inspector Yeom on His Appointment
  author: Lee Kyubo
  language: eng
  text: |-
    As the era returns to its beginning,
    the first spring at last unfolds.
    Yet the emissary remains distant,
    and I cannot personally present the wine of longevity.

    With reverence, I reflect on Inspector Yeom:
    His capacities vast and encompassing,
    his bearing graceful and distinguished.
    Mounted upon his carriage of inspection,
    his authority reverberates through the provinces.
    As the new calendar is proclaimed,
    felicitations gather within the halls of office.

    Though we humble servants are assigned to our posts
    and blessed by your magnanimous grace,
    our bodies remain bound to duty's seal.
    Thus we cannot kneel before your presence
    to offer our attendance and service.
