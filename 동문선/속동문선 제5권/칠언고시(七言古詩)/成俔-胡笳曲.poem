    석 점, 넉 점, 북두성은 밝고
    한 박, 두 박, 되 피리 소리
    되 피리 소리 속에 이슬이 성에 가득하니
    변방 사람 듣고 눈물이 줄줄
    달 아래 고향 집 생각, 그리워라, 그리워

  title: The Hu Jia Pipe
  author: Sung Hyun
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Three points, four points—the Northern Star glows bright.
    One beat, two beats—the hu jia pipe sounds.
    Within the hu jia's plaintive cry, frost fills the city.
    Border dwellers hear it; tears stream unbidden.
    Beneath the moon, thoughts of home become an aching longing.
  footnotes:
    - The hu jia (胡笳) is a double-reeded wind instrument associated with the frontier regions and often symbolizes the sorrow of separation and exile in classical Chinese and Korean poetry.
    - The Northern Star reference evokes the passage of night and the vast distance between the speaker and home, a common image in border garrison poetry.
