  text: 去年寒食長安道。百花香裏深醉倒。今年寒食塞上城。瀟瀟風雨隨行旌。循環歲事年復年。男兒行止皆關天。邊庭日暮人烟稀。孤村楊柳搖春霏。龍灣江上把一杯。杏花消息來不來。風光不减兩鬢改。明年何處更相待。

    작년 한식날 서울 길에선
    온갖 꽃 향내 속에 잔뜩 취해 넘어졌더니
    금년 한식 변새 성에선
    우수수 풍우가 가는 깃발 따르네
    해마다 철은 빙빙 돌아오건만
    남아의 행지는 모두 다 운명
    변방에 날 저물어 인연도 드문데
    외딴 마을 버들가지 봄비에 흔들리네
    용만 강변에서 술 한 잔을 드노라니
    살구꽃 소식은 오는가, 안 오는가
    풍광은 전 같으나 두 귀밑머리는 세었으니
    명년엔 어느 곳에서 다시 기다리게 될까

  title: Cold Food Festival on the Road
  author: Choi Suk-jeong

  text: |-
    Last year at Cold Food Festival on the Chang'an road,
    I collapsed drunk amid the fragrance of a hundred flowers.
    This year at Cold Food Festival in the borderland fortress,
    Whispered winds and rain follow the marching banners.

    Year after year the seasons turn and return,
    Yet a soldier's path is written by fate alone.
    At dusk on the frontier, the smoke of hearths grows thin,
    And lonely willows in a distant village tremble in spring rain.

    By Dragon Bay on the river I raise a single cup,
    Waiting—will word of apricot blossoms come or not?
    The landscape remains unchanged, yet my temples have turned gray,
    Where will I wait for you again when next year comes?

    - 'Cold Food Festival (寒食): A traditional spring festival held a day or two before Qingming, when only cold food was eaten. The poem uses it as a temporal marker, comparing the speaker''s experience at the festival in two different years.'
    - 'Chang''an: The ancient capital of China, here representing the speaker''s peaceful past.'
    - 'Dragon Bay (龍灣): Likely a specific location in the borderlands, or possibly a poetic name for a scenic river bend.'
    - 'Apricot blossoms: A traditional symbol in Chinese poetry for spring beauty and renewal, but here tinged with melancholy waiting and uncertainty.'
