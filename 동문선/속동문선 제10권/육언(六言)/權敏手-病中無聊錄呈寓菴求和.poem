    한 몸이 동서남북으로
    백년은 3만 6천 일이었다
    옛날의 백이 도척은 함께 없어지고
    숲속의 성현만이 오직 남았다네
    짧은 세상은 누른 쌀이 반만 익고
    긴 노래에 흰술이 석 잔이라
    사마상여는 다만 네 벽이 서 있을 뿐
    도연명은 귀거래사를 짓고자 하였네

  title: A Record of Tedium During Illness, Presented to Uam in Request of Verse
  author: Gwon Minsu
  language: eng
  text: |-
    One body scattered to the four directions—
    East, west, south, and north.
    A hundred years: thirty-six thousand days.
    From ancient times, the righteous and the wicked alike have vanished,
    Leaving only sages dwelling in stillness.

    In this brief world, the yellow grain half-ripens,
    Yet in long songs, white wine fills three cups.
    Sima Xiangru owns but four bare walls,
    While Tao Yuanming yearns to compose his return home.
  footnotes:
    - 'Boyi and Zizhi: legendary figures from antiquity representing righteousness and transgression, both ultimately forgotten by history'
    - 'Yellow grain: a reference to Zhuangzi''s butterfly dream; represents the fleeting and dreamlike nature of worldly existence'
    - 'Sima Xiangru: Han dynasty poet and scholar known for his poverty despite his literary talent'
    - 'Tao Yuanming: Tang dynasty recluse poet famous for ''Return Home'' (Guiqu Lai Ci), embodying the ideal of withdrawal from public life'
