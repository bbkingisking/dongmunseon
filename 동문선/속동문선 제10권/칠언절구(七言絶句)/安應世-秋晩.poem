    고국에 누른 국화꽃 피어 이미 지고
    솜옷이 이르지 않아 집 생각이 간절하이
    변성에 떨어지는 해에 풀빛이 변해질 제
    가을 바람 숲속에는 까마귀 울어 쉬지 않네

  title: Late Autumn
  author: An Eung-se
  language: eng
  text: |-
    In my homeland, golden chrysanthemums bloom and fall away.
    Winter clothes have not yet arrived—my heart aches for home.
    At the border fortress, the setting sun fades into withered grass,
    And ceaseless cries of autumn wind—a murder of crows through the trees.
  footnotes:
    - The chrysanthemum, a symbol of endurance and homeland, is juxtaposed with its inevitable decline, mirroring the speaker's separation from home.
    - The delayed winter clothes serve as a concrete reminder of distance and neglect, amplifying the exile's longing.
    - The 'border fortress' suggests the speaker is stationed far from home, likely a military or administrative posting in a frontier region.
