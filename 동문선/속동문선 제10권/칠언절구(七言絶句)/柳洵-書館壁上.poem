    어지러운 풍진 세게 밟아 거의 다하고는
    꿈속에 나는 걸음 글집으로 들어갔소
    해를 따른 백발은 부질없이 천길이라
    맑은 조정의 임 옷 깁는 실은 못 된다오

    I have trampled through the dusty tumult of this turbulent world,
    Until in dreams my feet take flight and enter the halls of books.
    With each passing year my hair turns white—a thousand fathoms of it—
    Yet I can never become the thread that mends the robes of court.
  footnotes:
  - key: ''
    value: The 'thread that mends the robes of court' refers to serving the king with distinction and loyalty, a traditional metaphor for official service and contribution to the state. The poet expresses how his withdrawal into study, though enriching to the spirit, cannot fulfill the duty of direct service.
