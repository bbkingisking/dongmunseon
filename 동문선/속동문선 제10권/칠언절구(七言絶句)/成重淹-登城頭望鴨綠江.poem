    맑은 강물 흰 깁인 양 갈꽃은 가을이라
    두 언덕 밝은 모래 흰 해오라기 내렸어라
    해질녘 이 강산이 무한히 아름다우니
    내 낀 물결 어이하여 시름 자아내나

  title: Viewing the Yalu River from the City Wall
  author: Sung Jung-eom
  language: eng
  text: |-
    The clear waters stretch like white silk, reed flowers mark the autumn—
    Both banks bright with sand, white herons descend.
    As the sun falls, these mountains and waters hold endless beauty,
    Yet why do the misty waves stir such sorrow in my heart?
  footnotes:
  - key: ''
    value: The Yalu River (압록강) forms the border between Korea and China, making it a historically significant subject in Korean poetry. This poem likely dates to the Joseon period when such border landscapes held particular cultural resonance.
  - key: ''
    value: The image of waters 'like white silk' (練, yeun) is a classical poetic convention borrowed from Chinese verse, suggesting both the river's clarity and its precious, delicate nature.
