    비 내리려다 말고 강안개만 젖었는데
    반쯤 피다만 들꽃은 차가워라
    봄 성 2월에 석잔 술로써
    남으로 온 여러 일을 판정하여 한가하도다

    Rain threatens but does not fall—only river mist dampens the air.
    Wild flowers half-bloom, shivering in the cold.
    In the spring city, two months of wine—three cups—
    And I settle all the affairs that followed me south into leisure.
  footnotes:
    - '''Spring city'' refers to the capital or a major city during the spring season'
    - The 'three cups' may reference both literal wine drinking and the traditional poetic motif of wine as a means to transcend worldly concerns
