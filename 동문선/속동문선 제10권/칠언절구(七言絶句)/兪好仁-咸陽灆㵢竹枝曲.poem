    성 남쪽 또 북녘에 닭 돼지 요란할 제
    밭 기도가 끝이 나자 들 비는 어둑 어둑
    태수의 봄놀이 권농하기 위함이라
    때로는 가마 타고 행화촌을 찾아드네

  title: Bamboo Branch Songs of Hamyang
  author: Yu Ho-in
  language: eng
  text: |-
    South of the city and north of the walls, the chickens and pigs clamor loud,
    When the field rituals end, the rain falls soft on darkening clouds.
    The magistrate's spring journey seeks to encourage the farmer's toil—
    At times his palanquin winds through the apricot blossom village.
