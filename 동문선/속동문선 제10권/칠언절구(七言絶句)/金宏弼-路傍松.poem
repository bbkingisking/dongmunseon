    한 늙은이 푸른 수염 길 티끌에 맡겨두고
    고생하여 오가는 손 보내고 맞이했소
    이해가 차가웁다 너와 심사 같게 하리
    지나치는 사람 중에 몇몇이나 보았더냐

  title: The Roadside Pine
  author: Kim Hong-beop
  language: eng
  text: |-
    An old one, grey-bearded, surrenders to the dust of the road,
    Laboring to welcome and farewell the endless stream of travelers.
    In this harsh season, my heart aligns with yours—
    Among all who pass, how many truly see?
  footnotes:
    - The pine tree is a traditional symbol in East Asian poetry representing steadfastness, integrity, and constancy through hardship. Here it serves as both observer and companion to the speaker's solitary vigil.
    - The 'harsh season' (歲寒) carries philosophical weight, evoking both the literal cold and the metaphorical trials that reveal one's true nature and values.
