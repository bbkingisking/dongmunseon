    이 몸이 이 세상엔 이미 병신 되어
    동서남북 어느 곳에 그칠 줄 모르노라
    우습고야 시인에게 빛 남아 있어
    작은 다리 비바람에 돌로 나귀 모는고야

  title: On the Road from Suyeong Castle
  author: Shin Jong-ho
  language: eng
  text: |-
    This body has become useless to the world,
    Wandering east and west, north and south with no place to settle.
    How absurd—the poet still carries old debts unpaid,
    Riding a donkey alone through wind and rain over a small bridge.
