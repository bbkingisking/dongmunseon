    영대 거치른 것 스스로 김매지 않고서
    부질없이 괴로이도 오거서만 외웠노라
    백년을 분주해도 남북이 희미하니
    뉘라서 이 세간에 넓은 곳이 있다 하오

  text: |-
    The temple of my spirit grows rank with weeds,
    yet I do not lift a hand to tend it.
    I toil and suffer to memorize ten thousand books,
    yet gain nothing but exhaustion.
    A hundred years I rush between north and south,
    the path ahead blurs into mist.
    Who in this world believes there is a spacious home,
    a place where the weary soul can rest?
  footnotes:
    - The 'temple of the spirit' (靈臺) refers to the mind or soul in classical Chinese philosophy, drawing from the concept of inner spiritual cultivation.
    - The 'five carts of books' (五車書) is a classical allusion to vast learning and erudition, suggesting the speaker has devoted themselves to scholarly pursuits.
    - The 'broad dwelling' (廣居) alludes to Mencius, referring to righteousness and virtue as the true foundation of peace and rest.
