    산산한 환패 소리에 뭇 신선이 모여들어
    나를 끌어 만곡 배에 오르누나
    해 지자 내 낀 물결 가이 없고
    흰 해오라기 날고 물은 하늘 같아라

  title: In Response to the Poem on Nanpu
  author: No Gong-pil
  language: eng
  text: |-
    The tinkling of jade pendants gathers immortals—
    they draw me aboard a vessel laden with ten thousand bushels.
    As the sun descends, the mist-wrapped waters stretch beyond sight,
    while white gulls drift and the water becomes sky.
  footnotes:
    - Nanpu (南浦) is a classical reference to a place of farewell and journey, often evoking themes of separation and adventure in East Asian poetry. The title indicates this is a response poem following the rhyme scheme of an original work on this theme.
    - The 'jade pendants' (環佩) evoke the ornaments of celestial beings, establishing the ethereal, otherworldly tone of the poem.
    - The 'vessel laden with ten thousand bushels' suggests both a grand, magnificent boat and the weightiness of the journey undertaken.
