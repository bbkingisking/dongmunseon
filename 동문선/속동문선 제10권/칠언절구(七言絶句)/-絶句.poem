    십 리 긴 뚝 위에 풀은 방석인 양
    남포에 비 어둡고 푸른 마름 길었어라
    지는 꽃 우는 새에 무료하기 짝이 없어
    싸릿문 굳게 닫고 한 봄을 지났노라

  text: |-
    Ten miles of embankment, grass like a cushioned seat,
    Rain dims the southern shore where blue duckweed stretches long.
    Falling blossoms and crying birds—endless tedium—
    I shut my rustic gate and let the spring pass by.
  footnotes:
    - The 'southern shore' (南浦) is a traditional poetic reference to a place of departure or longing, often evoking themes of separation and melancholy.
    - The image of grass as a 'cushioned seat' suggests both the comfort and emptiness of nature's indifference to human emotion.
    - The act of closing the gate against spring's beauty represents a deliberate withdrawal from the world, suggesting either resignation or meditation.
