    자다 일어나 창문을 손수 밀쳤더니
    나무 끝에 남은 달이 오히려 배회하네
    봄 하늘이 점차 새고 숲까지 흩어질 제
    누워보니 푸른 메가 지게 속에 들어오네

  title: 'Morning Rising: A Letter to Kangzai'
  author: Lee Chang-soo
  language: eng
  text: |-
    I awake and push open the window with my own hands.
    On the treetop, the lingering moon still lingers and wanders.
    As spring's sky gradually brightens and the forest crows scatter,
    Lying still, I watch the blue mountains enter through my door.
  footnotes:
    - Kangzai (强哉) likely refers to the recipient of this poem, possibly a friend or fellow scholar. The title suggests this is a morning composition sent to that person.
    - The 'lingering moon' reflects the transition between night and dawn, a liminal moment favored in classical poetry.
    - The final image of mountains entering the room through an open door suggests both literal perspective and metaphorical openness—the boundary between inner and outer dissolving in the morning light.
