    하얀 옥갈퀴에 가는 달이 걸려 있고
    서리 바람 이슬 국화 가을 뜰에 가득
    시름 묻을 곳을 하느님은 마련 못한 채
    모두 한창을 향하여 흰 머리만 심었다오

  title: Lamenting Autumn
  author: Shin Jong-ho
  language: eng
  text: |-
    The moon, delicate as silk, hooks upon white jade.
    Frost wind, dew, chrysanthemums crowd the autumn courtyard.
    Heaven's maker has no place to bury sorrow—
    Only toward the cold window does he plant white hair.
  footnotes:
    - The 'white jade hook' is a traditional metaphor for the crescent moon in Chinese poetry. Here it suggests both beauty and fragility.
    - The chrysanthemums, dew, and frost create a melancholic autumn atmosphere, traditionally associated with reflection on time's passage.
    - '''White hair'' is a poetic expression for aging and the accumulation of life''s sorrows.'
