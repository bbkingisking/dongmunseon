    소년 때 호탕한 기운 제멋에 놀던 것이
    이다지 쇠퇴하여 노성될 줄 알았으리
    또 가을 바람이 나의 길을 속였으니
    구들에 바로 앉아 평생 일을 세누나

  title: Rhyming with Verse on the Wall of the Liaoyang Residence
  author: Yoo Sun
  language: eng
  text: |-
    In youth, my spirit ran wild and free,
    swaggering without restraint through life.
    How could I have known such vigor would fade,
    that recklessness would ripen into age?

    Now autumn wind deceives my wandering path,
    and I sit firm upon this earthen floor,
    counting the years of my life gone by.
  footnotes:
    - Liaoyang was a diplomatic and trade post in Manchuria, suggesting the poet was traveling as an official envoy or merchant
    - The earthen floor (구들) refers to the traditional Korean ondol heating system, evoking both humble circumstances and reflection in settled life
