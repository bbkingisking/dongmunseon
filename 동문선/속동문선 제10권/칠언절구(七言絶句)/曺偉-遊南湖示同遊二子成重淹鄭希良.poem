    노는 고기 날개 치고 푸른 물결 깊은데
    숲 새소리 관관하여 나의 시를 답하는 듯
    물은 절로 뜻을 얻고 천기 절로 이룩한다네
    이제 나는 물건 보고 하늘 마음 보았노라

  title: 'At Southern Lake: Shown to My Two Companions in Travel, Seong Jung-eom and Jeong Hui-ryang'

    Fish leap and thresh their fins through green waves deep,
    Forest birds call and answer back my song.
    All things achieve their purpose by themselves—
    The Way moves on, its timing always true.
    Now as I watch the world, I see Heaven's heart.
  footnotes:
    - The poem plays on the philosophical concept that observing nature reveals the fundamental principles (Heaven's heart) underlying all existence, a common theme in Korean Neo-Confucian poetry of this period.
    - The birds 'answering' the speaker's verse suggests a harmony between human expression and natural response, reflecting the Daoist ideal of wu-wei (effortless action) in the second couplet.
