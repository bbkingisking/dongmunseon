    여윈 말 더디가니 역마을 멀어지고
    숲 넘어 삽살개 짖는 건 그 뉘 집이냐
    황혼에 달이 지고 교원이 검었으나
    앞마을 메밀꽃만 내 알괴라

  title: On the Road Through Yongje

  text: |-
    A lean horse trudges slowly, the relay station fading behind,
    Beyond the forest, a watchdog barks—but whose house is that?
    At dusk the moon sets and the fields turn black,
    Yet I can still make out the buckwheat flowers of the village ahead.
  footnotes:
