    혼자서 하늘 돌리려다 그치기를 아니하고
    한 깃발 오늘에는 남녘 고을 향하였네
    그대를 만류하는 말 한 마디 없이
    녹록히 벼슬만 지키니 그 부끄럼 어이하리

  title: Lines of Feeling Offered to Chi-geon Upon His Appointment as Magistrate of Gimhae
  author: Shin Jong-ho
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Alone you strive to turn the heavens, refusing ever to cease—
    Today your banner points toward the southern provinces.
    I have no words to hold you back as you depart,
    Yet here I sit, clinging to office in comfortable shame.
  footnotes:
    - The 'turning of heavens' refers to attempting to influence fate or change circumstances through virtue and effort, a Confucian ideal.
    - The 'southern provinces' refers to Gimhae, located in the Gyeongsang region of Korea's south.
    - The speaker's 'comfortable shame' suggests the contrast between the recipient's active virtue and the speaker's passive bureaucratic existence.
