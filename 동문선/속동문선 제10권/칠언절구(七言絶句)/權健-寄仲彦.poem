    때에 중언이 도승지로서 낙직되었다[時仲彦以都承旨落職]
    일진의 서늘 바람 낮 꿈을 깨는고나
    북창에 높이 누워 글을 읽었노라
    종남산 그 풍월을 뉘라서 관령할고
    반쯤은 그대에게 또 반쯤은 나에게로

  title: A Letter to Zhong Yan
  author: Kwon Geon
  language: eng
  text: |-
    A cool breeze stirs, scattering the remnants of my midday dreams.
    By the north window, I lie high upon my pillow, reading.
    Who shall tend the wind and moon of Zhongnan Mountain?
    Half belongs to you, half remains with me.
  footnotes:
    - Zhong Yan (仲彦) held the position of Minister of Personnel (都承旨) before his dismissal, which prompted this reflective poem. The poem was likely sent as a gesture of solidarity during his fall from office.
    - Zhongnan Mountain (終南山) is a famous mountain near Chang'an, traditionally a symbol of refuge and contemplation in Chinese poetry.
