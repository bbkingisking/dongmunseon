    대 그늘을 거닐매 작은 정자 경치 맑고
    시 읊는 객의 수염 몇 줄기나 끊겼던고
    세상 일 한이 없고 꽃은 절로 지는데
    그윽한 숲의 새는 비 개었다고 즐겨하네

  title: In Response to Zizhen's Rhyme
  author: Lee Yun
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Walking through bamboo shade near the small pavilion—how clear the air.
    The poet's beard grows thin, a few more strands turned white.
    Worldly cares are endless, yet flowers fall of their own accord.
    In the quiet grove, birds rejoice at the breaking clouds.
  footnotes:
    - Zizhen (子眞) likely refers to another poet whose work this poem responds to, following the classical Chinese poetic tradition of 'responding rhyme' verses.
    - The greying beard serves as a metaphor for the passage of time and the poet's aging amid constant worldly turmoil.
    - The final image of birds rejoicing at clearing weather contrasts with human sorrow, suggesting nature's indifference to human concerns.
