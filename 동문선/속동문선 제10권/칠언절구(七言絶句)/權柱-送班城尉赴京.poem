    만리에 저 풍운이 장회에 들어올 제
    임을 보내 서로 향해 금대에 오르려니
    역마을 초초히도 임의 옷에 스쳐
    칼 치며 우렁찬 노래 술이 한 잔

  title: Sending Off the Commandant of Banseong to the Capital
  author: Kwon Ju
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Ten thousand miles of wind and cloud stir within my noble heart.
    I send you westward to ascend the golden terrace.
    At the parting pavilion, the post-horse hurries—your traveling robe trembles.
    I strike my sword and sing out bold—with one cup of wine.

    value: The juxtaposition of hurried departure with the speaker's unhurried gesture of drinking and singing creates the poem's central tension—the mingling of melancholy parting with resolve and dignity.
