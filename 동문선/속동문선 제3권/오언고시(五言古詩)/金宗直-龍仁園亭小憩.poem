  text: 驅馳數百日。半日聊息駕。玲瓏樹陰中。愛此淸風榭。使君早飛舃。殘吏能迎迓。亭亭荷萬柄。罇罍襲水麝。小魚游且跳。浮萍蹔成罅。隱几正熟睡。山鳥鳴上下。夕陽在前川。行人猶未舍。誰知闕輔地。偸此一餉暇。岸巾更浩吟。干掫來警夜。

    이리저리 몇 백 날을 달리다가
    예 와서 잠깐 반나절을 쉬네
    아롱진 나무 그늘 아래
    시원한 바람 부는 이 정자
    사군은 일찍 서울 가고
    아전들이 제법 날 맞아 주네
    우뚝우뚝 서있는 만 줄기 연꽃
    술병에 향내가 풍겨 오는데
    피라미가 놀다가 퍼뜩 뛰어오르니
    부평이 잠시 금이 가누나
    책상을 의지하여 낮잠이 드니
    산새들이 아래위서 울어대고
    석양이 앞내에 기울었는데
    행인들은 아직도 길 가고 있네
    뉘라서 알았으리, 내 여기 와서
    한참 동안 여가를 얻을 줄이야
    갓을 쓰고 다시 시를 읊으니
    야경꾼이 와서 밤을 알리네

  title: A Brief Rest at the Yongin Garden Pavilion
  author: Kim Jong-jik
  language: eng
  text: |-
    For months I have ridden hard through days without end,
    But here I find half a day to catch my breath at last.
    Beneath the delicate tracery of tree-shadows,
    I cherish this pavilion where cool winds gather.

    The magistrate departed early for the capital,
    Yet his clerks remain to greet me with ceremony.
    Lotuses stand in their thousands, tall and dignified,
    While fragrant wine-cups rest upon the water.

    Small fish dart and leap in play,
    And duckweed trembles, opening tiny cracks.
    Leaning against a desk, I drift into afternoon sleep,
    As mountain birds call back and forth above and below.

    The setting sun lingers on the stream before me,
    While travelers still journey on the road.
    Who could have known that I, reaching this place,
    Would steal away an hour of precious respite?

    Adjusting my hat, I compose verses once more,
    When the night watch arrives to announce the coming dark.
  footnotes:
    - Kim Jong-jik (1431-1502) was a prominent Neo-Confucian scholar and official of the Joseon dynasty, known for both his administrative service and literary accomplishments.
    - The magistrate's early departure and the ceremonial greeting from clerks suggest the poet's unofficial status as a visitor, allowing him this rare moment of leisure.
    - The progression from active travel to sleep to evening suggests the passage of a single day, compressed into a meditation on the value of brief respite.
