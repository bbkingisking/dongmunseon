    종남산이 새벽에 푸릇푸릇
    저 멀리 높은 성이 보이네
    북창에 그윽한 꿈을 깨니
    비 온 뒤에 인생이 서늘쿠나
    들앉아 있느라니 조용도 한데
    좋은 새가 화답하여 울음 우네
    애오라지 대와 국화를 심어
    세상을 초월하고픈 내 뜻 맞추리라

  title: An Ancient Poem
  author: Yoo In-chum

  text: |-
    Mount Zhongnan glows blue-green at dawn,
    Distant, the layered city towers rise.
    From my north window, a tender dream disperses—
    After rain, the world grows cool upon my soul.

    Sitting alone here, how deep the stillness,
    Yet noble birds answer with their song.
    I plant bamboo and chrysanthemums at whim,
    Matching the longing that dwells within my heart:
    To transcend this world, to slip its grasp.
