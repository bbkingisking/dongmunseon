    창이 밝았다 어두워지는 동안 도로 일이 생기나니
    남가의 한바탕 꿈 영화와 치욕일세
    기틀을 알아 능히 일찍 물러난 내가 아니라
    병든 몸이 억지로 공명 따르기 어려웠네

  title: To My Colleague Mint Jipui Seon

  text: |-
    Between the bright window and the darkened one, affairs arise anew.
    A dream of Southern Bough—glory and disgrace in a single span.
    I am not one who grasps the way of things and withdraws in season,
    Yet these failing bones cannot be forced to chase after fame.
  footnotes:
    - The 'Southern Bough' (南柯) refers to a famous Tang dynasty tale of a dream in which a man ascends to high rank and experiences both fortune and ruin, ultimately realizing the emptiness of worldly ambition.
    - The poem reflects on the transience of political office and honor, suggesting the speaker's weariness with the pursuit of official status.
