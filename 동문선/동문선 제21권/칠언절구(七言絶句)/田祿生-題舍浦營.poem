    이 땅에 와서 논 지 십 년이 가까운데
    어찌 또 이 진에 와서 이 새벽이 있을 줄 알았으랴
    저 벽의 졸한 글자여 나를 아는가
    누가 바로 그 당시에 너를 쓴 사람인가

  title: Inscribed at Sappo Camp
  author: Jeon Nok-saeng

  text: |-
    Ten springs have passed since I roamed these lands,
    Yet how could I have foreseen this dawn at the garrison?
    Rough characters upon the wall—do you remember me?
    Who was it that inscribed you in those bygone days?
