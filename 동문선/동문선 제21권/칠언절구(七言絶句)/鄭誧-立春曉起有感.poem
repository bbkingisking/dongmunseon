    봄술과 봄깃발이 지난해와 같은데
    부엌 사람 일찍 일어나 등 앞에서 말한다
    이 때에 정담을 같이할 손은 없고
    절기를 느끼고 어버이를 생각하며 한 번 눈물 흘리네

  title: Spring Morning Feelings on the First Day of Spring

    Spring wine and spring banners, just as they were last year.
    The kitchen servants rise early, speaking by lamplight.
    Yet no companion is here to share my thoughts this season—
    Feeling the turning of the year, remembering my parents, I shed a tear.
