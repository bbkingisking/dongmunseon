    옛날에 선인이 동래에 부임할 때
    나는 겨우 강보에 싸인 어린애였었는데
    오늘 여기 오매 백성들 기꺼이 맞아 주나니
    마치 내 몸이 고향에 돌아온 것 같아라

    Years ago my father came to serve in Dongnae,
    when I was but a swaddled infant in arms.
    Today as I return, the people greet me with joy—
    and I feel as though I've come home to my native place.
  footnotes:
    - Dongnae (東萊) is an ancient name for the Busan region in Korea's southeast. The poem reflects on the author's return to a place where he spent his early childhood, evoking the bittersweet recognition of a homeland half-remembered from infancy.
