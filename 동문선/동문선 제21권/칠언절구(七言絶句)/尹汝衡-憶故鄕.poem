    물가의 매화꽃은 눈 속에 피었는데
    밤은 깊고 밝은 달은 누대에 떠오르네
    이 속에서 내 시를 지으면 응당 묘하리라
    한가로이 나귀 타고 돌아가련다

    By the water's edge, plum blossoms bloom through the snow.
    Deep in the night, the bright moon rises over the tower.
    Here my verses should compose themselves with wonder—
    I shall ride my donkey back home, carefree and alone.
