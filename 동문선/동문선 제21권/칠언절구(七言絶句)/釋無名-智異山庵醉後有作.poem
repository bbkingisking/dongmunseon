    이름과 이익을 구하는 것은 한가함만 못하거니
    구름과 안개 속에 자취를 감춘 지 25년이었네
    일을 좋아하는 어떤 사람이 와서 내게 술을 권하여
    가사가 반쯤 젖었으니 푸른 산이 부끄럽다

  title: Composed While Drunk at a Hermitage on Jiri Mountain
  author: Seok Mumyeong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    To seek fame and fortune—how inferior to idleness.
    For twenty-five years I've hidden my traces among clouds and mist.
    Who comes to tempt me with wine and friendly counsel?
    My robe dampened with drink—I shame the green mountain.
