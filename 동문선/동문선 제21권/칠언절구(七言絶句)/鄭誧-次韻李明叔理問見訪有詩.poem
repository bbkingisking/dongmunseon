    돈 있거든 빈 술병 대하지 말고
    일 없거든 부디 자주 술잔을 들라
    좋은 철을 여러 번 근심 속에 지내었고
    좋은 꽃은 흔히 병 앓을 때 피는구나

  title: In Response to a Poem by Yi Myeong-suk the Scholar-Official
  author: Jeong Po
  language: eng
  text: |-
    When you have wealth, do not face an empty wine vessel—
    When you have leisure, by all means reach often for the cup.
    Fine seasons have slipped away many times while sorrow held me,
    And lovely blossoms bloom so often when illness keeps me abed.
  footnotes:
    - This is a poem written in response (次韻) to verses by Yi Myeong-suk, a visiting scholar-official. The form requires matching the rhyme scheme of the original poem while presenting new thoughts.
    - 'The poem plays on the tension between the external goods of life—wealth, time, seasons, and beauty—and the internal states that prevent us from enjoying them: poverty of spirit, purposelessness, sorrow, and illness.'
