    시냇물은 잔잔하고 돌길은 비꼈는데
    도인의 집처럼 고요한 데 없으리라
    뜰 앞에 누운 나무 봄인데도 잎이 없고
    온종일 산벌들은 풀꽃을 뜯어 삼키네

  title: The Nine Luminaries Hall
  author: Lee Je-hyeon
  language: eng
  text: |-
    The stream murmurs softly, the stone path winds in shadow.
    Where in this world is solitude like a hermit's dwelling?
    Before the courtyard, a fallen tree lies bare in spring—
    All day long, mountain bees feed greedily on wildflowers.
  footnotes:
    - The Nine Luminaries Hall (九曜堂) refers to the nine celestial bodies in classical astronomy. Lee Je-hyeon likely named his retreat after this astronomical concept, suggesting a place of contemplation aligned with cosmic order.
    - The fallen tree bearing no leaves despite the spring season suggests either age, decay, or the selective stillness of the hermit's retreat—a space beyond the ordinary cycles of nature.
