    승평을 오가는 동안 절물이 바뀌나니
    보내고 맞이할 때 농사철을 방해한 것 못내 부끄러워라
    둿세상에 전할 만한 덕이 없다고 말하지 말라
    최군의 팔마비를 다시 일으켜 세웠다

  title: Inscription on the Eight Horses Monument of순천
  author: Choe Won-u
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Through peaceful years the seasons turn and pass,
    In welcoming and sending, I confess our shame—
    to steal the farmer's time.
    Speak not of lacking virtue worthy to transcend,
    For here the Eight Horses Monument of Master Choe
    rises once again.
