    세상에도 드물게 충신이 밝은 임금을 만나
    명을 받들고 하늘에 조회하러 길이 구름 속으로 들어간다
    〈임금과 신하〉 생각하노니 구중 앞 자리에서 말할 때에
    밤음 깊어 금전에 달이 어른거리리

  title: On the Occasion of an Official's Journey to Pay Respects at Court, When the Distinguished Gentlemen Divided Characters for Poetry, I Received the Character 'Profuse'
  author: Hong Tak
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Rarely in this world does a loyal minister meet an enlightened lord—
    Receiving his command, the path to court ascends into clouds.
    I envision the discourse before the Nine Thrones,
    Where moonlight flickers profusely through the golden palace at midnight.
  footnotes:
    - The 'Nine Thrones' (九重) refers to the innermost chambers of the imperial palace, symbolizing the emperor's presence.
    - The poem was composed as part of a literary game where each participant received a character to incorporate into their work; Hong Tak received the character 'profuse' (紛).
