    영양포 어귀에는 갈대꽃이 흰데
    앙덕암 곁에는 강나무가 붉구나
    약속 있어 조각배에 거문고와 술을 싣고
    금모래 여울 위로 시옹을 찾아가네

  title: Visiting Scholar Gwon at a Village Cottage in Mangpo
  author: Sung Sa-hong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    White reeds bloom at the mouth of Youngyang Inlet,
    Red trees line the banks by Angdeok Rock.
    With promise made, I load my small boat
    With zither and wine, seeking the poet-sage
    On the golden sandbars.
  footnotes:
    - Youngyang Inlet and Angdeok Rock are specific geographical locations, likely in the region where Scholar Gwon resided.
    - The 'poet-sage' (詩翁) is an honorific reference to Scholar Gwon, suggesting his reputation as both poet and wise man.
