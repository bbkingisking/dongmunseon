  title: 손을 송별하려고 말을 재촉하여 호루에 이르니 손이 벌써 가서 배에 올랐으므로

    손을 강 머리서 송별하렸더니 손은 이미 돌아가고
    배에 올라 술 마시며 부질없이 시를 찾네
    한하노니 고륙(진(晉)나라의 화가 고개지(顧凱之)와 육탐미(陸探微))의 단청의 손이
    쇠옹의 말 달리는 때를 그려내지 못하였구나

  title: Seeing Off a Guest by Hurrying Horse to the Lake Tower, but Finding Him Already Gone and Boarded—A Poem Upon the Occasion
  author: Kwon Sa-bok
  language: eng
  text: |-
    I hurried to see my guest off at the river's edge,
    only to find he'd already turned back and gone.
    Boarded upon his boat, I drink alone
    and idly search for verses in the wine.

    I lament—had I the brush of Gu and Lu,
    those master painters of the Jin,
    I might have captured on silk
    this old man's galloping horse and fleeting time.
  footnotes:
  - key: ''
    value: Gu and Lu refer to Gu Kaizhi (顧愷之) and Lu Tanwei (陸探微), renowned painters of the Eastern Jin dynasty, known for their exceptional skill in capturing movement and the human figure.
  - key: ''
    value: The 'old man' (衰翁) is the poet himself, expressing regret at the impossibility of capturing the bittersweet moment of departure through art.
