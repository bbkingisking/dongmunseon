    천 년 옛 나라 삼한의 사신이요
    만리 넓은 물결에 한 조각의 배일러라
    바다 동쪽에 머물러 있다 해 저문 것 놀라니
    산달은 쓸쓸한데 물은 다락을 밝히네

    An envoy of the ancient kingdom, three Hansouth of a thousand years,
    A single leaf of boat upon ten thousand miles of rolling waves.
    Stayed in the eastern sea, amazed as the year draws to its close,
    The mountain moon grows desolate while waters illuminate the tower.
