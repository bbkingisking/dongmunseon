    호연히 돌아갈 뜻 흰 구름 가을인데
    태학의 여러 유생들 붙들 수 있겠는가
    고당을 모셔 받드느라 틈이 없으리니
    어찌 저 영호루에서 한 번 취할 수 있으랴

  title: Sending Off Kim Ja-su, Student of the National Academy, as He Returns to Andong to Pay Respects to His Parents
  author: Park Sang-choong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    With resolute heart to return, white clouds fill the autumn sky—
    How could the students of the Great Academy persuade him to stay?
    Attending to his aging parents leaves him no spare moment,
    So how could he linger drunk upon the Yinghu Pavilion tower?
  footnotes:
    - The Great Academy (太學) refers to the national university where promising scholars studied.
    - Yinghu Pavilion (暎湖樓) was a famous pavilion associated with leisure and drinking, representing the temptations of the capital that the recipient must leave behind.
    - The poem celebrates the recipient's filial duty, portraying his return home as more compelling than the pleasures of scholarly life in the capital.
