    이 숱한 늙은 나무 빽빽히 들어선 두 산 사이
    온 골짝 풍연 속으로 말을 타고 돌아온다
    이것은 지금까지의 명리의 길 아니거니
    세상 사람 어찌 청한한 맛 알까보냐

  title: On the Road Through North Mountain
  author: Hong Eon-bak
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Between two peaks, a thousand ancient trees stand thick,
    Through misty valleys on horseback I return,
    This path is not the one of fame and gain
    that lures the world—how few can taste such peace.
  footnotes:
    - 北山 (North Mountain) likely refers to a specific mountain region in Korea known for its natural beauty and as a retreat from worldly concerns
    - The poem contrasts the quiet simplicity of nature with the pursuits of worldly ambition, a common theme in East Asian literati poetry
