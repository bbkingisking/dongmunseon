    천지가 넓고 넓은데 나는 집이 없거니
    하루 저녁에 등불 돋우고 아홉 번 일어나 탄식하노라
    누가 멀리 나온 사람에게 귀가 있게 하였는가
    두견새가 두견꽃에 피 쏟으며 우나니

  title: A Traveler's Night in the Eastern Mountains
  author: Yun Yeohyung
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Heaven and earth stretch endless—I have no home.
    One evening, lamp in hand, I rise and sigh nine times over.
    Who gave ears to the wanderer so far from rest?
    The cuckoo pours its blood into the cuckoo flowers as it cries.
  footnotes:
    - The cuckoo (杜鵑) is a traditional symbol in East Asian poetry representing homesickness, longing, and the pain of separation. According to legend, the bird's cry sounds like 'go home, go home' (不如歸去).
    - The pairing of the cuckoo bird with cuckoo flowers suggests the poet's empathetic identification with nature's own melancholy—both bird and bloom share the same name and suffer together.
