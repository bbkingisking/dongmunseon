    진흙을 차는 여윈 말로 산성을 지나다가
    찬 등불 다 돋우고 비소리를 듣고 있다
    나그네 길은 해를 따라 끝나지 않거니
    명년에는 어디서 설을 맞이하려나

  title: Written on the Wall of Imshil County
  author: Seon Tan
  language: eng
  text: |-
    A lean horse treads through mud, crossing the mountain town.
    I trim the cold lamp's flame and listen to the rain.
    A traveler's path does not end when the year runs out—
    where will I greet the new spring next year?
  footnotes:
    - Imshil County (任實縣) is located in present-day North Jeolla Province, Korea. The poem was likely written on a wall during the poet's travels through the region.
    - The 'cold lamp' suggests both the literal lamp in an inn and the loneliness of exile or wandering.
    - '''New spring'' (新正) refers to the lunar new year, traditionally a time when one returns home or celebrates with family.'
