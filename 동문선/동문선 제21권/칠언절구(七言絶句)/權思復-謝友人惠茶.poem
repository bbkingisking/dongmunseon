    남국의 옛 친구가 새 차를 보내 왔네
    한낮 창에서 자다 일어나면 맛이 더욱 좋겠건만
    차가 사람의 잠 적게 한다니 도리어 싫어라
    잠 자면 걱정 잊는데 잠이 적으면 어찌할꼬

  title: In Thanks for Tea Sent by a Friend
  author: Gwon Sa-bok
  language: eng
  text: |-
    A friend from the southern lands has sent me fresh tea.
    After sleeping by the noon window, the flavor grows ever deeper.
    Yet they say this tea steals away one's sleep—how it vexes me!
    Sleep erases all my sorrows, but without it, what becomes of me?
  footnotes:
    - The 'southern lands' likely refers to the tea-growing regions of China or Southeast Asia, emphasizing the precious nature of this gift.
    - 'The poem plays on a classical paradox: tea is prized for its invigorating properties, yet the speaker values sleep as an escape from worldly cares, creating a tension between pleasure and sorrow-forgetting.'
