    봄에 갈고 김 매려 하자 여름이 몹시 덥더니
    가을 수확도 끝나기 전에 하늘은 벌써 차네
    어떻게 하면 이 정자를 연의 길에 옮겨 올꼬
    군왕이 농민의 이런 고생을 한 번 볼 수 있을 것을

  title: The Pavilion of Watching the Harvest
  author: Oh Soon
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Spring arrives and weeds must be pulled as summer's heat beats down relentlessly.
    Autumn's harvest barely finished before the sky turns cold.
    If only this pavilion could be moved to the royal procession's path—
    then perhaps the King might witness the farmer's endless toil.
  footnotes:
    - The 'pavilion of watching' (觀稼亭) serves as a metaphorical vantage point from which to observe the hardships of agricultural life. The poet's wish to relocate it to the royal road suggests a desire for the monarch to truly see and understand the suffering of his people.
