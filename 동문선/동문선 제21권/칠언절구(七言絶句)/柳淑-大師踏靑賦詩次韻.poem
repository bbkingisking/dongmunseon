    유와 석이 서로 예부터 전해 오네
    몸도 한가한데 하물며 좋은 숲과 샘물이 있음에랴
    가절에 한 번 취하는 것 내 어찌 싫어하리
    백 년이 여울에 내리는 배와 같거니

  title: Rhyming with a Poem the Abbot Composed on an Outing to Appreciate the Spring
  author: Yuk Sook
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Confucian and Buddhist paths have flowed together since ancient days.
    With leisure in my body, what fortune to have fair forests and springs!
    To be drunk once on this perfect moment—how could I ever tire of this?
    A hundred years drift like a boat descending the rapids.
  footnotes:
  - key: ''
    value: The 'abbot' (대사, dae-sa) refers to a Buddhist monk of high rank. The poem is written in response to another poem the abbot composed during a spring outing (답청, dap-cheong—literally 'treading green,' a traditional springtime excursion through nature)
  - key: ''
    value: The final image of the boat on the rapids suggests both the swift passage of time and a paradoxical acceptance of life's transience through surrender to its natural flow
