    저 숱한 늙은 나무는 구름과 연기를 스치는데
    머리 뒤에는 푸른 한 자리만한 하늘일세
    여윈 말도 산의 자태 좋은 줄 알았는가
    바람 앞에 우뚝 서서 채찍에 끄떡도 아니하네

  title: On the Road Through Suryeon Mountain Valley
  author: Yun Yeohyung
  language: eng
  text: |-
    A thousand ancient trees brush against clouds and mist—
    Above my head, a vast expanse of azure sky.
    Even my lean horse knows the mountain's graceful form,
    Standing firm against the wind, unmoved by any spur.
  footnotes:
    - Suryeon Mountain Valley (隨緣山谷) suggests a place where one follows the natural course of circumstances, reflecting the Buddhist concept of随缘 (following conditions or fate).
    - The 'lean horse' may symbolize the poet himself, worn by travel yet sustained by appreciation of natural beauty.
    - The final image of the horse standing immobile despite the whip suggests contentment and acceptance rather than resistance or fatigue.
