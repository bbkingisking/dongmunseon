    말을 몰고 유유히 작은 시내 건너노니
    저녁 볕 묵은 비에 풀만 어지럽구나
    산마을의 사월에 행인은 적고
    깊숙한 나무에는 누른 꾀꼬리 자유로이 우네

  title: Along the Road to Huieum Temple
  author: Jeong Po
  language: eng
  text: |-
    I drive my horse leisurely across the shallow stream.
    On the ancient stone marker, evening sun—the grass grows wild and tangled.
    In the mountain village of April, few travelers pass,
    While in the deep trees, golden orioles sing freely, at ease.
  footnotes:
    - Huieum Temple (惠陰院) was a Buddhist temple located on a well-traveled route in medieval Korea.
    - The 'ancient stone marker' suggests a roadside monument worn by time, emphasizing the solitude and remoteness of this journey.
