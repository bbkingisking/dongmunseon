  text: 溪深柳密乳鴉飛。滿路淸陰信馬歸。畢竟功名將底用。回頭五十二年非。投壺圍坐箭輕飛。淸興時時醉欲歸。來往共君成二老。人生此樂未爲非。

    시내는 깊고 버들은 빽빽한데 새끼 가진 갈가마귀 날으나니
    길에 가득한 맑은 그늘 속을 말을 타고 돌아온다
    필경 공명은 무엇에 쓰는 것인가
    머리 돌리매 오십 이년을 그르치었네
    둘러앉아 투호 높이에 화살이 가벼이 난다
    맑은 흥은 때때로 취해 돌아오려 하네
    그대와 함께 왕래하면서 두 늙은이 되었나니
    인생의 이 즐거움 그르다 할 것 없다

  title: Following the Rhyme of Choe Sa-rip at Cheonsu Temple
  author: Hong Eon-bak
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Deep runs the stream, thick grow the willows, and mother crows take flight.
    The shaded path lies green before us as we turn our horses homeward.
    What use, after all, are fame and fortune?
    Looking back, fifty-two years have slipped away.
    Circled together we play at pitching arrows, light they fly.
    Clear spirits stir in us, growing drunk on the desire to depart.
    Wandering here and there beside you, we have grown into two old men.
    This joy of living—there is nothing wrong with it.
