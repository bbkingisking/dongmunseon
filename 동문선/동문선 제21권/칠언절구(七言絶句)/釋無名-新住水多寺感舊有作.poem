    십 리 소나무 사이에 관도가 큰데
    한 소리 쇠북 뒤에는 범궁이 그윽하다
    산에 가득한 잔나비와 새들아 이상히 여기지 말라
    며칠만 지내면 같이 놀 수 있으리라

  title: Reflections on Returning to Sudasa Temple in Sinjusong
  author: Sseok Mumyeong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Ten miles of pine-lined roads stretch wide and grand,
    After a single stroke of the temple bell, the dharma hall grows still.
    Monkeys and birds crowding the mountainside, do not wonder at my return—
    In but a few days' time, we shall play together once more.
  footnotes:
    - Sudasa Temple (水多寺) was a historical Buddhist temple. The poet, a Buddhist monk, is revisiting a place from his past.
    - The 'dharma hall' (梵宮) refers to the Buddhist temple and its sacred space, suggesting both spiritual retreat and nostalgic memory.
    - The poem's gentle address to the mountain creatures suggests the poet's previous familiarity with this place and his joyful anticipation of renewed communion with nature.
