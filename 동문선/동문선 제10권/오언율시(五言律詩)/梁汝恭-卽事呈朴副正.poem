    가히 더불어 말할 사람은 적고
    뜻이 같지 않은 일은 많네
    옛 성현들도 오히려 이러했거든
    지금의 나야 더 말해 무엇하랴
    말하고자 하다가 도리어 입을 다물고
    노래 부르려다가 홀연히 슬피 탄식하네
    눈 앞에 천만 가지 계책 중
    어느 것이 취해 읊조림 만하리

  title: Presented to Park the Vice-Director Upon Witnessing the Moment
  author: Liang Rugong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    How few are those with whom one can truly speak,
    How many are the things that go against one's heart.
    Even the ancient sages knew this fate—
    Then what more shall I say of myself?

    I open my mouth to speak, yet silence holds me still,
    I prepare to sing, but sighs escape instead.
    Ten thousand schemes swirl before my eyes—
    Which one deserves the drunken poet's tongue?
  footnotes:
    - The recipient of this poem, Park the Vice-Director, was likely a contemporary official or patron of the poet. The poem serves as both a personal lament and a respectful presentation.
    - The final image of 'drunken poet's tongue' alludes to the classical tradition of poets finding truth and freedom through wine, suggesting that perhaps intoxication offers what reason cannot.
