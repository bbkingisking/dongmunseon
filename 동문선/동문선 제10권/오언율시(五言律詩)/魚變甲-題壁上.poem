    돌아와 머물은 곳은
    담만 둘린 두서너 칸 집이어라
    비바람 속에 형제가 이야기하고
    아침저녁 부모님의 얼굴이
    네 문에는 쌍 시냇물 소리
    다락엔 네 창이 다 푸른 산이어라
    오직 임금과 신하의 의리를 어쩌나
    벼슬 쉬는 것은 어렵지 않지만

  title: Written on a Wall
  author: Eo Byeon-gap

  text: |-
    I have returned to my place of rest—
    a modest dwelling of two or three rooms,
    walled in simply.

    In wind and rain, brothers speak together,
    and morning and evening bring my parents' faces.
    At my gate flows the sound of twin streams,
    and from my upper room, all four windows frame
    the green mountains.

    Yet how can I resolve the bond
    between ruler and subject?
    To step away from office is not difficult—
    but the weight of that oath remains.
  footnotes:
    - The 'twin streams' and 'four windows' suggest both literal architectural features and metaphorical openness to the natural world, a common trope in Korean retirement poetry reflecting Neo-Confucian values of virtuous withdrawal.
    - 'The final couplet reveals the poem''s tension: despite achieving the peaceful retirement idealized in earlier lines, the speaker cannot escape the moral obligations of public service and loyalty to the throne.'
