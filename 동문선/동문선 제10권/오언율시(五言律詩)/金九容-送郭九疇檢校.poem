    만리 천왕이 땅에
    어느 해 싸움의 티끌이 그치려는고
    장군은 바야흐로 도끼를 받는데
    사신은 멀리 이웃 나라를 사귀러 왔네
    발섭해서 창해로 왔다가
    달리고 달리어 임금에게로 돌아가네
    이제부터 서로 눈을 닦고
    거듭 지원 봄을 보게 하세

  title: Sending Off Guo Jiuzhou on His Inspection Tour

  text: |-
    Across ten thousand li stretches the heaven-king's land.
    When will the dust of war at last settle?
    The general receives his axe of command,
    while the envoy comes far to bind neighboring states.

    Through mountain and stream to the azure sea he traveled,
    then galloped and galloped toward the purple palace.
    From this day forward let us wipe our eyes clear—
    we shall see the Zhiyuan spring bloom anew.
  footnotes:
    - The 'heaven-king's land' refers to the vast empire under imperial rule, likely during the Mongol Yuan dynasty period.
