    용사는 오히려 격투를 하고
    호표는 아직도 날뛰네
    풍진이 그치는 것을 보지 못하는데
    어찌 한가히 강호로 갈까
    몸 있음이 참으로 큰 짐이어서
    여생을 붙일 땅이 없네
    적막한 밤중 꿈
    처량하게 나라를 떠나는 마음이네

  title: Night Dream
  author: Seol Son

  text: |-
    Dragons and serpents still grapple in combat,
    Jackals and tigers yet rampage unchecked.
    I see no end to the dust and turmoil of the world—
    How can I wander freely by river and lake?

    To possess a body is truly a heavy burden,
    There is no refuge where I can lay down my remaining years.
    In the desolate depths of this midnight dream,
    My heart grows sorrowful, longing for the land I left behind.
  footnotes:
    - The 'dragons and serpents' and 'jackals and tigers' represent the warring factions and chaos of the political world.
    - The poem reflects the poet's sense of alienation and exile, suggesting a withdrawal from the turbulent affairs of state into solitary contemplation.
