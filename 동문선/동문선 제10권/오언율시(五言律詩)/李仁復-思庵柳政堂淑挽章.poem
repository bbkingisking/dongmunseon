    잠저 때 좌명하였고
    공을 이룩하기는 젊은 나이였었네
    충성이 밝아 해를 꿰뚫는 데도
    헐뜯는 말들은 가만히 하늘을 속였네
    몸이 물러나도 오히려 화를 면할 수 없었고
    이름은 높아 더욱 전하리
    임금님의 은혜로 이미 시호를 추증하였으니
    또한 구천에 혼령을 위로할 만하네

  title: Elegy for Saam Jung Dang Yu Suk
  author: Lee In-bok
  language: eng
  text: |-
    From the prince's court you rose to aid the throne,
    Achieving greatness in your youthful prime.
    Your loyalty blazed bright as sunlight burning,
    Yet slanderers deceived the heavens in the dark.

    Though you withdrew, misfortune still pursued,
    Your name ascends to echo through all time.
    The sovereign's grace has honored you with titles—
    Even in the depths below, your spirit finds its peace.
  footnotes:
    - This is a commemorative elegy (만장) composed upon someone's death. The 'prince's court' likely refers to service during the sponsor's time as a prince before ascending to power or influence.
    - The concluding image of '구천' (the nine springs) is a classical allusion to the underworld or the realm of the dead, suggesting the comfort brought by royal recognition even in the afterlife.
