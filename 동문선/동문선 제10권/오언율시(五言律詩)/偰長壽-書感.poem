    생계는 가난이 항상 따르고
    돌아갈 기약은 매양 난리가 방해하네
    물마른 고기를 누가 즐겨 건져줄까
    집짓는 제비는 한갓 스스로 바쁘네
    길에는 풍진이 어둡고
    기구 세업은 거칠어졌구나
    다락에 올라 바다를 바라보나니
    만리가 휑하니 푸르구나

  title: Reflections While Writing
  author: Seol Jang-su
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Poverty clings to life's path, my constant companion.
    The promise of return is ever thwarted by calamity.
    Who would deign to rescue a fish in a dried-up stream?
    The swallow building its nest knows only its own frantic toil.
    Along the roads, dust and wind obscure all light.
    The family trade and ancestral work lie neglected and wild.
    Climbing to the loft, I gaze across the vast sea—
    Ten thousand miles stretch out, empty and serene in their blue.
  footnotes:
  - key: ''
    value: The 'dried-up fish' and 'swallow building its nest' are classical allusions expressing isolation and the futility of one's labor without external aid or recognition.
  - key: ''
    value: The 'family trade and ancestral work' (기구 세업) refers to the poet's duties as a member of the literati class, suggesting neglect of scholarly and familial responsibilities.
  - key: ''
    value: The final image of gazing seaward from the loft suggests both longing for distant home and philosophical distance from worldly troubles.
