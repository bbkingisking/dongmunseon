    공북루를 새로 세우니
    경신 시월 초이네
    시는 권찬선으로부터요
    공은 윤상서에게서 비롯하였네
    옛길에는 단풍나무가 우거지고
    맑은 못에는 파란 하늘이 거꾸러졌네
    머뭇거리며 높아 해는 저물어 오니
    산빛이 정녕 내 시름을 자아내네

  title: Inscribed on Gongbuk Tower
  author: Kwon Han-gong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    A new tower rises at Gongbuk,
    In the tenth month of the Gyeongsin year.
    The poem comes from Kwon the Censor,
    The work springs from Yun the Minister.

    Along the ancient path, red maples flourish,
    In the clear pond, azure sky hangs inverted.
    Hesitating as daylight wanes above,
    The mountain's hue stirs this sorrow in my heart.

    value: 'Gongbuk Tower: Located in Seoul, this tower faces north (gong means to bow or face, buk means north), suggesting reverence toward the Chinese court during the Joseon dynasty.'
  - key: ''
    value: 'Kwon the Censor and Yun the Minister: These likely refer to the officials involved in the tower''s construction, with the poet playfully attributing the composition to his colleague Kwon while crediting the structural work to Minister Yun.'

    value: 'Gyeongsin year: Refers to 1680 in the traditional East Asian sexagenary cycle.'
