    열 해 동안 글을 읽던 곳
    포의로 이제 다시 와 노네
    긴 소나무는 옛길을 덮었고
    어지러운 돌은 찬 시냇물에 씻기네
    대낮에도 산마을은 어둡고
    봄철의 골짜기는 그윽하네
    언제 만기를 거느리고 와
    한번 웃으며 이 강루에 올라볼까

  title: On the Jade Tower of Mount Lu Temple
  author: Kwon Han-gong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Ten years I spent reading in this place,
    Now, dressed in simple cloth, I return to wander.
    Long pines shade the ancient path,
    Rough stones are worn smooth by cold streams.
    Even at noon the mountain village lies in shadow,
    The spring-filled gorge remains in quiet darkness.
    When will I come with ten thousand riders,
    And laugh aloud upon this river tower?
  footnotes:
    - Mount Lu is a sacred mountain in China, famous as a retreat for scholars and monks, establishing the context of literary and spiritual pursuit.
    - The 'ten years' and return with 'ten thousand riders' suggest a meditation on ambition—the contrast between youthful scholarly retreat and future power or status.
    - The river tower (江樓) was a common gathering place for poets and officials in East Asian tradition, symbolizing both literary achievement and official recognition.
