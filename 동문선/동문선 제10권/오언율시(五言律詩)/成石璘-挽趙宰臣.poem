    온화한 나의 어여쁜 벗
    얼마나 정담을 몇 번이나 나누었던가
    반드시 어진 사람이 수하는 것도 아닐세라
    속절없이 장자의 풍만 남았구나
    책시렁 위에는 티끌이 쌓이고
    약 화로에는 불이 꺼졌네
    슬프다 평생의 일은
    송추에 밤달이 둘리었네

  title: Elegy for Minister Cho
  author: Sung Seok-lin
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Gentle was my cherished friend,
    How many times we shared our deepest thoughts—
    Yet the virtuous are not assured of long years;
    Only his noble bearing lingers on.

    Dust settles upon the shelves of books,
    The flame dies in the medicine brazier.
    Ah, the sorrows of a lifetime spent—
    Now the moon at night wraps the pine and grave in shadow.
  footnotes:
    - The poem mourns the death of a government minister named Cho, using traditional imagery of loss and impermanence. The medicine brazier and extinguished flame suggest the end of life and healing efforts.
    - The final image of pine trees and graves under moonlight is a classical motif evoking both the dignity of the deceased and the melancholy passage of time.
