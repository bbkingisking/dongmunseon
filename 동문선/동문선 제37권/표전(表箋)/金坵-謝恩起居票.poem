  text: 중국에 관광(觀光)하옴에 균천(鈞天)의 꿈을 깬 듯하오며, 외번(外藩)에서 축수를 들임에, 다만 숭악(嵩岳)의 세 번 부름을 다하나이다. 하물며 봄이 되었사오니 더욱 경사가 많으시리이다.

  title: A Petition of Gratitude for Audience
  author: Kim Gu
  language: eng
  text: My journey observing the Middle Kingdom felt like awakening from a dream of celestial music. As a tributary realm offering felicitations, I have merely exhausted the triple acclamations of the sacred mountain. Yet now that spring has arrived, surely blessings shall multiply.
  footnotes:
    - The 'dream of celestial music' (鈞天) refers to an ancient Chinese legend of immortal music heard in heaven, evoking the wonder and ephemeral nature of the diplomatic mission.
    - The 'triple acclamations of the sacred mountain' (嵩岳之三呼) alludes to traditional court rituals of praise, particularly associated with Mount Song, one of China's most sacred peaks.
    - The reference to spring signals renewal and continued prosperity for the patron state, a conventional concluding sentiment in formal court petitions.
