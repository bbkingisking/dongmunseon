  author: Lee Je-hyeon
  language: eng
  text: With the Eastern Sea as my domain's boundary, I have received this gracious appointment. In my humble station beneath the Northern Star, I pledge my unwavering loyalty.
  footnotes:
    - The Eastern Sea (東海) refers to the eastern frontier of the Korean peninsula, likely indicating the author's provincial posting.
    - The Northern Star (北辰) is a traditional metaphor for the ruler, derived from Confucian imagery of the sage-king as the fixed pole around which all things revolve.
