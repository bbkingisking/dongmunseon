  text: 일찍이 용안(龍顔)을 뵈옵사옴에 보통보다 더욱 정성이 간절하오며, 매양 봉조(鳳詔)를 받자옴에 지척(咫尺)에서 위엄을 친히 접한 듯하나이다.

  title: Memorial of Gratitude and Obeisance
  author: Kim Gu

  text: Having once beheld the Dragon Countenance, my devotion grows ever more fervent than in ordinary times. Each time I receive the Phoenix Edict, it is as though I stand in the very shadow of imperial majesty, feeling its presence as near as a hand's breadth away. Such is the diligence of my distant prayers, illuminated by the Great Radiance above.
