  text: 효도로 다스리는 풍도(風度)가 하토(下土)에 달하여 상사(喪事)에 쓸 물품이 상천(上天)에서 내리시니, 돌아보건대 이 외롭고 조그만 몸이 어찌 고맙고 자랑스러운 은혜를 감당하리이까.

  title: A Statement of Gratitude for Provisions
  author: Choe Yuseong
  language: eng
  text: |-
    The wind of filial governance reaches down to the humble earth below,
    And the gifts for mourning descend from above—from celestial benevolence.
    Yet turning inward upon this solitary, diminished frame of mine,
    How can I bear the weight of such gracious and magnificent favor?
  footnotes:
    - The poem employs the convention of mock modesty typical of thank-you compositions, where the speaker expresses unworthiness to receive official provisions and sympathy during mourning.
    - The 'wind of filial governance' refers to the moral influence of virtuous rulership, particularly as it manifests in the state's concern for proper mourning practices and support for the bereaved.
