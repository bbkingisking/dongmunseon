    요 임금 뜰은 낮기 세 자였으나
    천추에 그 덕을 남기었고
    진 시황 성은 만 리나 되었으나
    두 대만에 나라를 잃었네
    예와 오늘의 흐름 속에서
    능히 그 거울이 될 만하거니
    수황은 어이 생각하지 못하고서
    토목으로 백성의 힘 말렸던고

    Yao's court was but three feet low,
    Yet his virtue echoed a thousand ages.
    Qin's walls stretched ten thousand li wide,
    Yet two generations lost the realm.

    In the current flowing through past and present,
    A mirror to guide the wise—
    But why did the Sui emperor not consider?
    With stone and timber, he drained the people's strength.
  footnotes:
    - Yao refers to the legendary sage-king of ancient China, known for his humble virtue and moral governance.
    - The Qin alludes to Qin Shi Huang and the Great Wall, whose massive projects could not prevent the dynasty's swift collapse under his successor.
    - The Sui emperor likely refers to Yang of Sui, whose extravagant construction projects, including the Grand Canal, contributed to the dynasty's downfall.
    - The poem uses historical examples to warn against prioritizing grand material works over the welfare of the people.
