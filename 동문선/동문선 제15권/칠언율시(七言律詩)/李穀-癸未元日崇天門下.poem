    설날 아침 대명궁을 활짝 열어놓으니
    만국의 의관이 예로 다들 모이네
    호랑이ㆍ표범 문을 지켜 안팎이 엄숙하고
    봉새ㆍ난새 서반을 갈라 동ㆍ서가 엄연하네
    헌수 잔에 둥실 봄빛이 떠오르고
    시위들이 겹겹이 새벽 바람에 서있네
    나도 일찍 조복 입고 홀 들고 반열에 섰었더니
    천문에 머리 돌리매 그지없는 옛 생각

  title: New Year's Day Below the Gate of Heavenly Eminence
  author: Lee Gok
  language: eng
  text: |-
    On New Year's morning, the great palace of Ming opens wide its gates,
    And the robed and crowned of ten thousand lands gather here in ceremony.
    Tigers and leopards guard the threshold, solemn within and without,
    While phoenixes and mandarin ducks divide the ranks, dignified east and west.
    In the cups of birthday wine, the colors of spring drift and float,
    And the guards of the imperial procession stand row upon row in the dawn wind.
    Once I too wore the crimson robe and held the jade tablet among the assembled crowd,
    Yet gazing back at Heaven's Gate, my heart drowns in endless remembrance.

    value: The 'robed and crowned' refers to tribute-bearing officials and envoys from tributary states attending the imperial court.
  - key: ''
    value: The poet's nostalgia suggests he may have been present at such ceremonies in the past but was now separated from court life, making this poem a meditation on lost position and the passage of time.
