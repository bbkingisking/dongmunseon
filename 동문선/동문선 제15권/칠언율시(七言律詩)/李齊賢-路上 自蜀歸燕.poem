    말 위에서 촉도난(비파 곡조 이름)을 읊으며
    이 아침에 비로소 또 진관에 드네
    날 저문데 푸른 구름은 어부수를 격했고
    가을철 단풍은 조서산에 이었네
    문자는 천고의 한을 더하고
    명리에서 일신의 한가함을 뉘 얻었던고
    아아, 몹시도 그립구나, 저 안화사(경치가 좋다 한다) 앞길
    멋대로 죽장망해로 오가던것

  title: On the Road Returning from Shu to Yan
  author: Lee Je-hyeon
  language: eng
  text: |-
    Upon my horse I hum the melodies of Shu's distant roads.
    This dawn I pass once more through the Qin Gate.
    As twilight falls, blue clouds veil the Fisher's Stream,
    and autumn's crimson trees line the Bird-Mouse Mountains.

    The written word compounds a thousand years of sorrow,
    yet who can claim both fame and a carefree heart?

    Oh, how I long for that pleasant path ahead—
    where once in sandals and with bamboo staff,
    I wandered freely, coming and going as I pleased.
  footnotes:
    - The poem references Li Bai's famous work 'The Difficulty of the Shu Road,' establishing a dialogue with classical literature about arduous journeys.
    - The Qin Gate marks the boundary between ancient Shu (modern Sichuan) and Yan (modern Beijing region), representing the poet's passage from one realm to another.
    - The Fisher's Stream and Bird-Mouse Mountains are specific geographical landmarks along the historical route, grounding the journey in concrete reality.
    - The contrast between the driven pursuit of 'fame and profit' and the remembered simplicity of wandering with only a bamboo staff and straw sandals reflects a deep philosophical tension in the poet's heart.
